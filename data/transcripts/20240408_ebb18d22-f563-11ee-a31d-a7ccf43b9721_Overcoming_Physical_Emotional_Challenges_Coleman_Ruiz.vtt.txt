Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is Coleman Ruiz. Coleman Ruiz is a former Tier 1 Navy SEAL special operator. I think it's fair to assume that most of you have never heard of Coleman Ruiz before.

00:25.442 --> 00:48.670
And in fact, it was part of his former life job description to be largely covert, such that only his family and friends really knew what he did for a living. He is, however, now living as a civilian. And the reason I invited Coleman on this podcast was essentially to tell us his life story, which of course includes his time in the SEAL teams, but includes so much more that I'm certain is of value to everyone.

00:48.962 --> 01:05.023
Today, Coleman shares with you his remarkable journey from childhood through his teenage years into the military and some of the things that happened during his time in the military, which then informed his post-military civilian life and what it is to be a father.

01:05.250 --> 01:31.294
a husband, and somebody who has experienced tremendous loss at various stages of his life, as well as tremendous triumph. Indeed, if ever there was a life that could be framed within the context of the so-called hero's journey, it is the life of Coleman Ruiz. Coleman Ruiz's life is one that embodies focus and pursuit, family and friends and love, all the things that we think of in terms of having a rich life, but also one that includes many

01:31.394 --> 01:55.134
unforeseen tragedies, many unforeseen challenges, both internal and external. Coleman also shares with a rare and extraordinary degree of vulnerability, the extent to which challenges in life, both external and internal, have helped shape him as a human being. What follows is a discussion that everyone, male, female, young or old, and regardless of position in life, is sure to derive tremendous benefit from.

01:55.426 --> 02:23.390
Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. And now for my conversation with Coleman Ruiz. Coleman Ruiz, welcome. Thank you. Very excited to see you. It's great to have you here. I'm guessing most people are probably not

02:23.842 --> 02:51.518
familiar with Coleman Ruiz. So let's start at the beginning. Where were you born? What was the context of your home life? And maybe let's get up to maybe elementary school, middle school, and whatever top contour or deep details you want to get into. Yeah. We're all ears. Okay. I'll bring us up to seventh grade. Cause I would say that was probably the first big inflection point in my life. I grew up in, I was born in New Orleans.

02:51.714 --> 03:20.798
in a suburb called East, New Orleans East, we call it. And have older sister, two younger brothers. My dad was a welder. My mom was a dental assistant and we had a couple of boxers and the dogs and we had a very modest, very modest upbringing. I won't over dramatize it, but you know, admittedly, you know, sometimes we got cheese from the lady across the street who didn't want her welfare cheese and

03:21.506 --> 03:50.686
It was one of those. You know, I could tell my parents were fighting for every nickel. But it was great. I mean, my cousin grew up across the street from me. He's exactly my age. We had that at least some of my memory, Andrew, of it was it was very pleasant. I learned later that you forget a lot of things in your childhood that were unpleasant. But my initial memories when I started thinking about this kind of thing and, you know, as you and I have discussed, getting professional help.

03:50.818 --> 04:20.606
and you start to learn a little bit more about your childhood. But I remember it being very pleasant. You know, you've told me about your background in skateboarding and stuff. You know, we skateboarded the neighborhood. BMX was a big thing when we were kids. It was very much a rat the streets upbringing. There was a park behind the neighborhood. We would cut through the fence and go, you know, this kind of thing. I played football and baseball and very normal in that regard. I went to the neighborhood school. And then in sixth grade, I went to what was my high school,

04:20.738 --> 04:49.278
but it went fifth through 12th, called Holy Cross High School in the Lower Ninth Ward, which that spot is now vacated because the school, I went back after Hurricane Katrina, the whole school had to be moved. And I went there in seventh grade and it was a hellacious start. I mean, it was detention after detention, fist fight after fist fight and damn near. Were you the instigator of those fights? Probably some.

04:49.410 --> 05:18.430
I definitely fell in with the wrong crowd initially in that sixth and seventh grade years. And I wouldn't say it was so extreme that like it was complete mayhem, but I was definitely on, you know, problem situation number whatever when my parents were called in and it was kind of the last straw type thing. And I got cut from baseball. My grades were fine. I was always a pretty good student. It was just teenager shenanigans.

05:18.946 --> 05:46.942
And then I went out for wrestling. Can I just pause you for a second? So on the violence part, I have a little bit of experience with this, but violence can come from trying to protect others. Yeah. Instigating. It can come from the wildness, just trying to see what it feels like, experimentation, and any number of other things, all the way to pure sociopathy, which we know you are –

05:47.106 --> 06:14.526
not, um, and weren't. Do you recall feeling something inside that inspired this? Was it for attention? Did it feel good afterwards? Um, can you recall what, what it was about? I think it was the wildness thing, Andrew, honestly, it wasn't, I mean, I believe I don't have a malicious bone in my body. Like we all have that in us. Obviously my profession later in the military, you know,

06:15.394 --> 06:45.310
I was able to activate that and I feel like I still can. And I was certainly able to in sports, which is why that seventh grade year was really pivotal. But even now, it's funny. It's even funny you ask about the wildness because let me put it in movie terms. Like one of my favorite movie scenes of all time is in the movie, The Town. When Ben Affleck walks in the room, Jeremy Renner is the, you know, his partner essentially. And he walks in the room and he says, we're going to hurt somebody. I can't tell you.

06:45.474 --> 07:15.294
where, and I can't tell you when. And he pauses and Jeremy Renner takes maybe a three second pause and he says, whose car are we taking? He doesn't even ask. You know, he's just, they're just wild and excited about doing something wild. I don't promote like going to hurt somebody, of course. Were you the Affleck or the Renner? Affleck, excuse me, or Renner in that? I was, I feel like I was mostly the Renner. Put it this way. If you have some good idea this afternoon, I'm

07:16.162 --> 07:45.310
like, let's go fucking try this, I'm good. I'm ready. And I think it's just exciting. You know, I hate rules. I hate being told what to do. It's one of the things that was so frustrating about the military. The rules are in place for a reason. They're written in blood. I get all that. But we're so constrained sometimes. I think that was just all coming into fruition that seventh grade year. And I enjoyed going wild. Like, it was just fun. And frankly, we weren't. These fist fights and this trouble wasn't

07:46.018 --> 08:13.662
like going to get some kid, those other kids wanted the wildness too, you know? And so, but the school didn't want that. And then I went out for wrestling that year and I could put it all into the wrestling room and it was awesome. Before we talk about wrestling and why it was so meaningful as a channel for you, a little bit of neurobiology or else I wouldn't be Andrew Huberman.

08:14.018 --> 08:42.014
there's a really interesting phenomenon that one observes in both animals and humans, which is that somewhere around adolescence, when the hormone surge begins, but even before that, there's a phenomenon called dispersal. It's very different than fighting per se or sexual activity per se. It's a literal dispersal from one's home environment or an animal's nest in which animals and humans, and we're animals after all,

08:42.241 --> 09:04.830
start forging new environments in a very, as you point out, chaotic way. It's not organized. It's a little nuts. And biologists and neurobiologists in particular have observed changes in neural circuitry that drive this. So some of it's hormonal, but a lot of it is the brain taking all this input that one has been exposed to, sun, earth, food,

09:04.962 --> 09:33.886
others' social interactions, and starting to essentially throw the different paints, the different colors of paint together and just trying things. Some kids are more prone to this than others. It certainly has a hormonal component. Boys and girls tend to do this differently, but they both do it. And psychologists and neurobiologists see this as a fundamental shift in our underlying circuitry. So just a little bit of food for thought to put what you just described in context. With that said,

09:34.146 --> 09:58.718
Tell us about wrestling. I mean, Andrew, in many ways, like I said, that was the first inflection point. It was like immediate, I mean, immediate uptake. Within a week, I knew this was my thing. Maybe the first practice. What do you think it was? So when I was younger, my aunt and uncle, when I was like seven years old, they started taking me to road races. And I'm sure...

09:58.882 --> 10:26.526
Just running races. One mile and 5k races when I was a really small kid. For you to run. To run with them. They were into the road racing thing back in the day when it was brand new. You know, the 80s. I'm 48, so I was born in 75. So I was seven, you know, eight years old at the time. And I was into, like, obviously, can I win this race? I just, the pain of the effort was so comfortable. And then...

10:27.234 --> 10:55.998
It's kind of silly, but like I won the PT competition at like the Boy Scouts thing in Audubon Park. PT is physical. Yeah, physical training. And so I won like the whatever when I was young and built Boy Scouts or something. And then it just snowballed. Then I was just like the physical activity still today is, I mean, if someone said, what are you really in love with? It's that. And so when I walked into the wrestling room, it was so extreme compared to anything else I had ever done.

10:56.674 --> 11:24.190
football, baseball, whatever. I never really liked any of those sports. I played them all, but I didn't like them. And always, my dad wrestled in high school and college, and we were, you know, always rough and tumble in that regard. And Ivan had a couple of buddies in the teams, you know, who obviously were college wrestlers. There's a lot of wrestlers in the teams, and people would always joke about how we're so handsy. You know, our hands are always on each other. And

11:25.026 --> 11:53.246
That was just a thing for us. Like, I loved the close contact. I loved the fight of it. What I really love about combat sports, because I boxed in high school between wrestling seasons, was the respect. Tell me more about that. You just don't have... There are some, of course. Like, you can see guys hyping it up and doing their thing in UFC these days, and that's totally fine. But for the most part, if you have fighters of any type

11:53.986 --> 12:23.582
like in a setting when they don't have to do, you know, the stuff for TV and whatnot, they respect each other because, and they respect the effort and because you know what it takes and you know how hard it is to face another man in the middle of a mat with no equipment and nowhere to run and no timeouts and no one to tap in, that's extreme, you know? And it may not seem like high school wrestling is extreme, but,

12:24.354 --> 12:53.566
As you just mentioned, something about development, when you're 14 and you're facing another, that's the first time, is someone trying to take your life? No, they're not, but it feels that way. And then you go and you put in all these hours of training and you don't eat during the week and you run stadiums or you run levees and fireman's carries and all of it while you're not eating and making weight and you're in the sauna and it's just a very tough thing to do.

12:54.018 --> 13:20.670
combat sports, and I love the respect that it engenders between the people who do it. I think it was Sam Sheridan who wrote A Fighter's Heart, an excellent book. And for anyone, male or female, any age who's interested in the human spirit, I recommend A Fighter's Heart because it's about the different fight sports, but it's really about the path of self-discovery

13:20.898 --> 13:49.918
that occurs in various martial arts. And as you said, like, especially boxing is very gentlemanly. You touch gloves, you start, you know, then the, you know, the bell goes off, you go to your corner. Like it's, you know, sometimes people lose it, bite off people's ears and things like that. But for the most part, the sport is very structured. As you were doing this, what was happening with school? Did it help your academic studies? Did it keep them more or less the same? And how did your family and your peer group

13:50.018 --> 14:14.238
view what you were doing? Were you considered strange for liking wrestling so much? I mean, you're dieting, right? You're a young male dieting for purpose of sport and performance. You're sitting in saunas, you're running wrapped in plastic bags, all this. I mean, a good friend of ours who was also in the SEAL teams once said to me, he said, wrestlers are different. And I think he meant different in quotes. Yeah, I think that's true.

14:14.498 --> 14:44.190
You know, school, my grades immediately went up, Andrew. It was like, oh, my gosh. The discipline of all of it, my grades were always better in wrestling season than out of wrestling season. Interesting. Like, when I was cut loose out of the structure then, it wasn't good. And, you know, between seventh and eighth grade and all that, I didn't have any crazy shenanigans going on. I wasn't going to get kicked out of school or whatever. I was doing normal stuff for the age, but... So the fight stopped? Totally. Totally, because I could put it into...

14:44.738 --> 15:14.110
I could put it into the wrestling space, you know? And I think I grew up obviously in New Orleans and I think, you know, down there it's baseball, football, basketball. Wrestling is not, I mean, I was lucky to wrestle in college at all because it wasn't like Iowa was looking to recruit me. You know, they have plenty of people to recruit and they don't need any Louisiana wrestlers. Although Daniel Cormier grew up like north of the lake. He was four years younger. I was telling this to somebody, we don't know each other. I'd love to meet him. Super impressive athlete.

15:14.338 --> 15:42.046
We heard that, hey, there's some kid up in the North Shore, I think is where he grew up, whooping everybody's ass. And his name's Daniel Cormier, and then, you know, obviously the rest is history. But the sport is not big in Louisiana, which is all to say that we were kind of a unicorn. We had, it was very odd at my high school specifically, we had one coach, his son, either national runner-up, his name was Willie Gatson. Willie passed away.

15:42.210 --> 16:05.758
I think his son ended up at Iowa State and within the last five or six years was either a national champ or a runner-up. Willie, when I was in eighth grade, Andrew, Willie was at my high school. Like, I have no idea how Willie Gasson ended up in New Orleans, but we ended up with this cluster of wrestlers at that time with the right coaching. And a few kids were going to junior college and coming back and wrestling in college and coming back. And

16:06.434 --> 16:30.046
There were three or four guys, I remember specifically in eighth grade, because I started, at least in the junior high ranks, I started to take off my second year. These guys would abuse me in the wrestling room. They were seniors in high school. I was 112 pounds or 132 pounds my freshman year. And they would just, in my eighth grade year, and they would just abuse me. Define abuse. In all the legal, normal wrestling ways. Like, there's the...

16:30.658 --> 16:58.494
wrestling gets broken up, obviously, by weights. You got the heavyweights on one end of the room, the lightweights on the other end of the room, and the young kids stay with the young kids for the most part. And a few of these guys would drag me down to the varsity end, and I would wrestle with the middleweights, and they would beat the shit out of me. And eventually you get to the point where you're like, fuck this, I had enough. And that's when sort of things started to turn. But I think that wrestlers are different, and my peer group,

16:59.138 --> 17:27.998
One or two of my really good friends wrestled, but most of them played other sports. And so, but in every sense of the word, life got better for me because of that sport. It changed my life. So you wrestled all through high school. Oh, yeah. Yep. At that point, were you discovering relationships, girls? Were you partying? Were you a drinker? Used drugs? No drugs. I mean, it's New Orleans, right? It's like one of the things that was tough.

17:28.962 --> 17:57.886
I'm glad I got out of the city, frankly, because it was party time outside the season. Yeah, girls, girlfriends, normal stuff in that regard. Lots of drinking, lots of rat in the streets, you know, in those days in the 90s. But you kept it inside the lane lines. It sounds like no drunk driving, no arrests. Well, we did a little bit of that, but nothing crazy in that regard. I think I understood the consequences, and I really cared about my career. I really wanted to wrestle in college. My grades were excellent.

17:58.178 --> 18:27.038
My SAT scores, not so much. But I started winning really fast. And, you know, my last two years in high school, I was 89-0. And I almost won my sophomore year. So I was runner-up in the state my sophomore year. I always joke with the boys. All my boys are way better athletes than I ever could think about being. Your sons? Yeah, yeah. But in eighth grade, I made varsity. And it was like, was it eighth grade? Yeah, and I lost like.

18:27.906 --> 18:56.382
75% of the matches, you know, but you just grind it out. And it's how I got into the Naval Academy, which is a whole nother story. But so let's talk about that. So you finished high school. You head to the Naval Academy. Why the Naval Academy? There's actually a crazy story behind this, which maybe we'll circle back to, but the summer, gosh, I had forgotten that this started in seventh grade too. The summer between my seventh and eighth grade year,

18:56.610 --> 19:25.662
My grandfather was too young to join the Navy and he wanted to go to the Naval Academy during World War II. And he lied to the recruiter and he got into the merchant Marines. His, I'm pretty sure, first cousin. My uncle and my cousins are like first cousins once removed. My uncle, Jim Therrell, was at a family reunion in Mississippi, which we were at. And he didn't mention the Naval Academy. Family reunion ends, they all go home.

19:26.722 --> 19:54.814
And he starts sending me Naval Academy paraphernalia. I knew nothing about the military. And I just thought about it, you know, and he would send me stuff, you know, you didn't, we didn't have the internet, right? He's sending these booklets. And you don't like authority. No. I have not been in the military, but I've done some work with y'all. And there's a lot of hierarchy and authority. Yeah, that's true. The truth, Andrew, is like, it just seemed exciting.

19:55.010 --> 20:23.614
I wasn't really thinking about the implications as 18 year olds, you know, it looked very exciting to me and having gotten some professional help in the intervening years, what I really think was a big part of it was my parents got divorced my senior year in high school and the family unit just blew up. Right. And so it also represented an escape, you know, get out and go get your life out of the new Orleans and just go.

20:24.130 --> 20:52.766
Just go do something. Were you a part of that? Obviously you were a part of the family that got divorced. Was it chaotic? Was it controlled? You and I are the exact same age. We're both 48, born in 75. Back then it was a lot less common for people being, they called them broken homes back then. Yeah, that's right. Nowadays, I don't think they call that. Everyone just cites the statistic that more than half of marriages end in divorce as if...

20:52.962 --> 21:20.062
perhaps to normalize it, but that's more than half. Do you recall feeling distraught about that or was it just kind of the natural consequence of something you had observed a long time? You're like, oh, that kind of makes sense. No, it was a shock to me. It wasn't a shock to my older sister. I just remember, this was the thought at the time. This was like seared in my brain. This has nothing to do with me.

21:22.306 --> 21:52.254
That wasn't like some sophisticated view. It was mostly, fuck this, I'm not dealing with this. I have my own life. They're gonna have to do what they're gonna do, meaning my parents. I'm getting the hell out of here. Not a bad mindset for a kid at that stage. If it had been four years younger, that might not be the best mindset. But as you're heading off to college, that's a reasonably healthy mindset, as opposed to getting enmeshed in what happened and this and that. Can I ask you, at that stage, you're 17, 18 years old at that point. Were you journaling at that point? No.

21:52.578 --> 22:22.398
No, no journaling, no introspective work. Zero. No school psychologist. No thinking about or talking about your feelings. It's wrestling, Naval Academy, social things, school, SATs. Like very standard. We're almost like talking like a superficial list of like what happens at the end of high school in 1992. And Andrew, it's the word superficial. And I carried this forward for years, which I'm sure we'll talk about here in a second. Those binary focus...

22:22.594 --> 22:49.598
areas. Like I was literally just going after them at full steam, stronger, faster, more intensity with zero introspection, no excavation of the psychology of anything, just full steam ahead. Like, let's go. No meditation, no breath work. Zero. Which was not adaptive in the long run. And we'll get to how that

22:49.858 --> 23:18.398
played out in the long run, but nonetheless, you got into the Naval Academy. Didn't first. Okay. So I applied. I get, you know, my uncle's doing all this stuff. Anyway, I applied and I didn't, I still have the letter of the thanks, but no thanks. You know, you're not qualified. How'd that hit you? At the time, it hit me kind of like everything I did when that age, when it didn't work out, admittedly, Andrew, it was, it was like, there's gotta be a way around this.

23:19.298 --> 23:46.782
Like shit has to work out, but it, but it feels terrible, right? Like it, you have a moment of what do we do? And my kids have heard the story a million times. My wife was a blue chip swimming recruit for Navy. And so she was into the Naval Academy when she was at the beginning of her senior year of high school. Right. What's a blue chip. I mean, my understanding of blue chip is like, you are at the very top of the list and the coaches put you straight into the admission cycle saying,

23:47.170 --> 24:16.510
Nobody else gets in until this person does first. So they wanted her. They didn't want you. Not only was she a blue chip and I got the no, I guess. Well, the wrestling coach called me a couple of weeks after my no, which is now in May. I'm about to graduate from high school. I'm not accepted anywhere. You only applied one place. Actually, two, which you may bust out laughing when I tell you what the other one is because no internet. I got a mailer in a pamphlet from Stanford, the wrestling coach.

24:17.442 --> 24:46.014
I didn't know what Stanford was. I had no idea that the college was even prestigious. I didn't know they had a wrestling team. I filled out the application and wrote the letter thing, and I sent it into Stanford. Of course, never heard back from them. But I applied to two places, Stanford and the U.S. Naval Academy. Well, for those that follow wrestling. I didn't get into either. Right. That's a great story. And I'll just briefly mention that a few years ago, there almost wasn't a wrestling team at Stanford. They had plans to cut the wrestling team despite having a

24:46.178 --> 25:16.030
NCAA champion at Stanford. But, you know, the power of people gathering and petitioning works and wrestling and a few other sports that were being cut from the curriculum were spared. It's amazing. Yeah. Rescued. So happy to see that. Yeah. So that, so it, Stanford does have a wrestling team. So the coach, the coach back to like how I ended up getting in, I appreciated my, my college coach called and he said, I'm recruiting. I have one more spot at the prep school.

25:16.130 --> 25:43.390
which is in Newport, Rhode Island. I'm recruiting another kid from Pennsylvania. If he takes that spot, then I don't have anything left. And we were exploring going to prep school and stuff like that, oblique ways to get in. And he called me sometime in May, like right around graduation, and said, can you be in Newport in July? That kid went to, I think he went to Lehigh. And I went to the prep school. In Newport, Rhode Island. Yeah, in Newport for a year. I've been there. It's a nice place. Yeah, it's great. Yeah.

25:43.842 --> 25:58.814
And so you wrestle for, I mean, you do school, you know, you're in, West Point has a prep school and Colorado Springs has a prep school. And so we joked that my wife was first person in our class accepted and I was last, which is highly possible actually.

25:59.522 --> 26:28.350
I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG1, is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important, it's populated by

26:28.482 --> 26:51.582
gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the immune system, and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health. And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great.

26:51.778 --> 27:19.134
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman, and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera. And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2. Again, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2. So you're in Newport. Does that have a portal to...

27:19.362 --> 27:47.774
The Naval Academy? Yeah, if you graduate prep school, you're straight into the Naval Academy. Like they fully expect you to be there the next year. When junior year rolled around and senior year rolled around of high school, didn't anyone pull you aside and say, hey, you might want to like apply to a few other places. You might want to consider what you do if this doesn't work out. What did they assume you were going to do? They just head into the city of New Orleans and bust tables? Zero guidance, Andrew, really.

27:47.874 --> 28:15.326
like from my high school and I think the ecosystem I was in, like people just didn't really know how to do that. You know, how to apply to schools. I mean, my parents obviously helped when I applied to the Naval Academy, but when I, when I look at the system that kids go through now to go, you know, their process to find the best college experience, I never had one conversation with a guidance counselor about what to do.

28:17.090 --> 28:46.046
I just didn't. I mean, I just got very lucky. A few people, my high school wrestling coach intervened, I think at some point and called the Naval Academy to speak to the coach to say, you should give this kid a chance, but he didn't, they didn't know who he was. You know, I'm so lucky and so fortunate that I ended up where I ended up. It's why I took it so seriously. Like the focus with which I applied my time in high school, I took that to

28:46.306 --> 29:15.582
10x degree when I got to Newport because I knew this was my chance. There's something magical to that. I can relate to that. So you're in Newport. Yeah. And describe what a day was like. Is it all wrestling? You're taking general education classes like one does in the first two years of university? Yep. So the way the prep school is set up for the Naval Academy is they're basically teaching you the first semester of the Naval Academy. So you take calculus, physics, chemistry. I think you take an English class, et cetera.

29:15.874 --> 29:45.566
And you go through like a pretty hellacious first couple of weeks because you're away from the flagpole where no one can hear you scream. You know, you're up in Newport. You're not in Annapolis where everyone's watching. And you do a couple of hellacious weeks for an 18-year-old who's never been in the military before. So you're in the military technically if you go to this school. You're actually enlisted in the Navy. Okay. So they own you to some extent. Yeah. Yeah, they do. And then you do. You're wearing uniforms. You're jogging in the morning. You're doing salutes and marching. Yeah, the whole nine.

29:45.922 --> 30:15.390
Yup. Bugling, they're doing taps in the evening. Yup, all of it. Got it. Yup. And you live, there's 300 people at the prep school. It's distributed basically amongst folks coming from the fleet. So guys who did four or five years in the military somewhere and they're coming into the Naval Academy from the fleet and then athletes and then sort of a mixture of other folks who need a little extra school. Right. And so, and then you do a full school year, you're competing. It's basically a red shirt year. That's not a red shirt year. I competed up and down the East coast against

30:15.714 --> 30:44.318
you know, all the other prep schools and you finish that year in May and then, you know, you're done with the prep. The prep year is fine. It's a little bit of a shock when you're 18, but it's fine. I've always been curious about these military schools and the people that go to them and what happens to people there. Did you have any sense of patriotism prior to arriving at this prep school? And did that sense of patriotism, you know, I'm talking like love of country, understanding that

30:44.642 --> 31:12.862
the history of our country and its position in the international landscape. Are you thinking about that stuff? Are they feeding you that? Or is it really like wrestling, get through the march, shower up, go to the next thing? Is it very like plug and chug? No, no, the feeding of, and I really appreciated this, the feeding of those concepts starts when you get there. But I was deer in the headlights, Andrew. Like I didn't think about my life in this way at all when I was headed there. I mean...

31:13.218 --> 31:38.910
What you get very early, because the school very quickly starts to bring really high level accomplished people, colonels, admirals, whatever, generals, to expose you to these people. I do remember sitting there within weeks, like this is way bigger than I thought it was in terms of how serious this situation is, you know?

31:39.234 --> 32:07.486
and how serious this ecosystem of people take this because I didn't have, my dad wasn't an admiral. He was a welder in New Orleans. I didn't understand the bigness of it. One of the reasons I asked this is that various times throughout my life, I've had this experience of seeing people close to me doing incredible work. Like when I was a postdoc at Stanford, I had Nobel Prize, was given that one week to the guy next door to me. So you see him in the morning and you're hearing it on the radio.

32:07.650 --> 32:36.830
Obviously, I didn't have that kind of stature or talent in science. I think I'm a good scientist, but good enough to get tenure at Stanford. But then there are levels within the game. But there is something very special to the experience of having people close to you physically and in the same ecosystem as you described it, achieving amazing things. I also saw this in skateboarding. I mean, there were a lot of, let's just say, failures to integrate with normal life. But there were also some

32:36.962 --> 33:06.750
guys that I grew up with who started companies and set world records and had their pro models. And then if you zoom out from that and you go, wait, I'm in this community, it changes one's self view about what's possible. So I think that's what you're describing. And I think it's such an important thing for people to experience at some point, even if the goal isn't to be at kind of world scale, for people to realize that the town they grew up in, the family they grew up in, that context can expand. And so do you recall being at this prep school

33:06.882 --> 33:34.302
and kind of third person in yourself and thinking like, well, I'm Coleman Ruiz. I'm from New Orleans. I went from this to this to this, the way you've been describing it. And I'm here. And they're like, I'm around some incredibly impressive people. And I'm here. Like once you make that recognition that you're there, a whole bunch of things can open up. No, I actually came at it from the opposite way. And this has been a hard thing for me my whole life. And I have to watch out for this perspective is,

33:35.234 --> 34:03.806
I felt like every day I had to wake up and earn my place there. I was never good enough for myself ever. So next day up is a restart to prove myself again on whatever standard I'm picking that day, right? Looking back on it, I realize it was somewhat arbitrary because it was just day by day. I didn't think I'm Coleman Ruiz. I made it here. Look, I'm part of this. I was afraid.

34:04.962 --> 34:34.111
Mike Tyson talks about being afraid every time. I was afraid every day. And I fought for like a position in this place every day. Now, that was adaptive in some regard, right? Because to me it was, let's go. Like today's another new day and it's 100% all in, full go. I hope everybody's ready. Do you ever recall falling asleep at night and thinking like,

34:35.010 --> 35:03.998
Well, like... I had a good day. I had a good day or I'm scared, you know, they're going to discover I can't keep up or I can't keep up. All the time. So a lot of fear. I mean... Yeah. Yeah, a lot of fear. All the time. And some of it I do... I genuinely know and believe, Andrew, that it was well-intentioned. Like, I wanted to do a good job for the group, whatever group I was in. My platoon, my squad, in the case of the prep school. You know, that first experience, I mean, I was...

35:04.098 --> 35:33.470
talking about this with my wife the other day, just because stories come up. You know, we had a 25th reunion at the Naval Academy and this kind of thing. And I was a really good runner for my group in high school, like the people I was around. I ran cross country when I was younger. And anyway, I did, I suppose I'm going the other direction. I sort of did have some level of confidence in my ability. And then I got there and like all these college cross country runners, like my son is now, just crushing me. And I think...

35:33.634 --> 36:02.558
Sadly, because it was just sort of in me, that fed my fear. Like, shit, I thought I was better than this. Clearly, I suck. I have to get to their level. So I did have a very well-intentioned excitement around just do a good job with the people you're around. There's something fun to that and wild, you know, as we spoke about. But I was operating out of fear for decades. But there was a I need to get to their level.

36:02.754 --> 36:29.790
statement in there. It wasn't, I can't keep up. I better find a different path. No, no, no, no. I knew I could, I knew I could get to their level with enough work, you know? Was that something that your, your father or your mother or both had instilled in you that? Oh, for sure. Yeah. And my high school wrestling coach was, let's call it maybe from the old school. If you worked hard enough, you could, you could, you could get there.

36:29.954 --> 36:58.622
So this is the essence of growth mindset long before Carol Dweck coined the phrase growth mindset. It's there, I'm not there yet. When I first read her book, I'm like, when people teach us to shit when we were kids. Yeah. Well, some of us got it, some of us didn't, and it can be very context dependent, right? I mean, I think that's one of the more important and often overlooked aspects of Carol's work and Ali Crumb's work is that we can develop growth mindset in one domain of life, but then another domain of life, we get kicked in the teeth once and we're like,

36:58.914 --> 37:28.158
I can't do that. There's a carve out where I can't function. Some people do that, some people don't. And we don't understand enough about it to understand whether or not it's a global circuit. And there's a lot of context. But okay, so you're hanging in there at least. You're surrounded by some very impressive people. There's a lot of structure. So we're a long way from the pre-wrestling days. Oh yeah. Yeah. This is the opposite of chaos. Totally. This is structure.

37:28.322 --> 37:58.206
Yeah, you're told what to do every five minutes, more or less. And this is scary feelings. Fear is a scary feeling. But you're channeling it. And you said the unit of the day became important. It's like, what can I do today? Yes. You're not thinking about the week. You're not thinking about the season. You're not thinking about becoming some war hero down the line. You're just 24 hours. Do the next day. Yeah. How was your self-care at that point? Or is that built into the system? It's not built into the system, and it was zero.

37:59.106 --> 38:28.894
I mean, it really was Andrew, like it was the old school. We were not doing anything sophisticated back then. I mean, there's no, we stretched. And in the grand scheme of things, it's going to sound weird because there still is a lot of, you know, primal nature to combat sports. But in the grand scheme of things, we were probably on the upper end of sophisticated, like wrestlers jump rope.

38:29.058 --> 38:57.438
They stretch, they do aerobics, you know, been in a sauna since 1993. You know, it's like not purposeful, not to cut weight in a garbage bag, but there is some level of, some level of balancing out your training, you know? Wrestlers like to swim during the season because you're getting out of that hot room. Like you end up accidentally doing some of these things, but there was no self-care. So you eventually go to the Naval Academy,

38:57.538 --> 39:26.750
94. The actual Naval Academy. And that's where you met your wife. Yep. In 96, my sophomore year. So when you get there, what's different than the prep school? First of all, it's big in the macro, not just geographically big or footprint square footage wise. It's big. The concept is big. You know, like the superintendent of the school is a three-star admiral. You hear about his career. You know, you're 19 years old. You meet

39:28.034 --> 39:55.390
So there's two incredibly important people in my life in those early years at the Naval Academy. A guy named Doug Zembeck, who's dead now, who most people of my service time will know who he is. When I was on my recruiting trip to the Naval Academy and I was in high school,

39:55.682 --> 40:24.382
This is complete accident. Doug was a sophomore. We call them youngsters at the Naval Academy. He was a sophomore and we're the same weight class. So coach matched us up because it was my recruiting visit. And my first, this is back to being wild. Literally my first night on the grounds of the Naval Academy, I'm sleeping on Doug Zembeck's floor of his room with his other two roommates. And sometime around three or 4 a.m., I get woken up

40:25.378 --> 40:54.206
It's like a bomb goes off. There's a bomb didn't go off, but there's 12 other gorillas in the room, all wrestlers, maybe one or two other guys. And Doug is hustling. I don't know any of these people, Andrew. Like I just met Doug the previous evening. We just flew into town. He wakes me up. He's hustling me to get my shoes on. Again, I'm just this high school kid. And then within two to three minutes, all 15 of these gorillas

40:54.402 --> 41:23.646
bolt out of the room and Doug grabs me and I'm just following them, right? So we race out of Bancroft Hall. It's maybe four in the morning, 3.30, four in the morning. We race out of Bancroft Hall, the barracks, we run across the parking lot into Lejeune Hall. In Lejeune Hall is the swimming facility and the wrestling room. That's it. That's the only thing that's in there, right? The doors, we run up to Lejeune Hall. The doors of Lejeune Hall are locked with a chain on the outside and one of our

41:23.746 --> 41:47.998
Doug pulls on the chain so that the door is open enough at the top that the 142 pounder can climb up and like get inside that little gap in the doors and run over and open one of the doors that isn't chained. This is what you'll later do professionally. I still have exactly and what I frankly did as a kid like back in the day and so I'm terrified because I don't know what's coming you know and so you don't bother to ask what are we doing? There's no time.

41:48.354 --> 42:18.334
There's just no time. Like these guys are, to me, they're full blown war heroes. They're not, they're college kids, but I'm 17. They're 21. All these wrestlers, I'm hoping I'm going to come here and be their teammate. You know, we run into Lejeune hall, go to the second story. We climb up the utility ladder where public works goes to get in the ceiling above the white foamy ceiling tile things. So we're now on the catwalk where the HVAC guys would be working.

42:19.618 --> 42:46.622
And I'm starting to get a sense of what's coming. We go a couple feet down the catwalk. Everyone stops. Someone reaches over the catwalk and pulls one chalky ceiling tile out. So now you can look over the edge of the catwalk and see right through the ceiling into the diving well. Remember, the diving well has a 10-meter platform, and then we're another...

42:47.394 --> 43:13.118
I don't want to over exaggerate this. We have to be another 20 feet into the ceiling. So you're above the diving board. Oh, we're way above the diving board. We're five feet above the ceiling, which is 20 feet above the 10 meter. Got it. Right? And so, and now I've realized what's happening. And two or three wrestlers, they sort of, you climb over the catwalk, get, you know, backwards.

43:13.218 --> 43:42.526
get your hands all the way down and then very lower yourself in a reverse pull up so you don't kick the ceiling tile. And three or four guys go and you can hear them hit the water after what is a terrifyingly long time when you're, you know, my age. This is in the dark. Oh yeah. No one's supposed to be in there. And then one of the guys looks over when you're a recruit, you're called a drag. And they're like, drag, you're up. And I'm lowering myself.

43:42.786 --> 44:09.534
Andrew and I kicked the adjacent ceiling tile and it hits the dive tank and it turns into pancake batter and goes to the bottom of the pool. Oh my. And one of my teammates is like, you motherfucker. One of my future teammates, you know, he's going nuts. I drop, I live. And this is back to Doug. I come up, Doug clearly goes behind me, but I don't hear him.

44:11.010 --> 44:38.046
And one or two guys are going nuts, you high school piece of shit. Like you're going to go down to the 15 feet and pick it all up. And Doug comes up and he just blasts everybody. He's our responsibility. This is not his fault. We brought him here. Like just totally backs me up. And then the rest of the visit happens. I end up there. Doug's now a senior. I'm a freshman. And...

44:39.778 --> 45:09.118
He's just a legend. He was all American. And to this day, Andrew, you need to hear this loud and clear. Like for all the people you and I both know and the people I've been around, no other human in my life have I met with his physical and mental toughness, not even close. The guy was born in the wrong century is the way I describe him. And he was like my mentor and he was my guy, you know.

45:09.218 --> 45:38.718
And he was killed in 07. Marine. We'll talk about Doug. You've written about him. Yeah, he's unbelievable. So I feel like I know him a little bit, thanks to you. We'll get around to that for sure. I think people are getting a sense of where we're headed. So that's the, to answer your question about like that, the bigness of the Naval Academy, that's how it started for me. Like everything was just on steroids. You know, all these kinds of people. I get the impression, at least up until now, that

45:39.074 --> 46:01.182
You're kind of just, you just go with what's right in front of you. 100%. Like there isn't a lot of pause and reflect. Although your rudder is not haphazard. It's not random. No. Well, yeah, I can say right now you and I are as similar as we may be in certain respects.

46:01.730 --> 46:25.278
we're very different in this way. Like there isn't a, there isn't like a foraging, you know, in biology, we call them random walks. You know, a lot of, a lot of organization that comes out of biology is through random walks, like animal or human, like finds a node and moves. And, and life is like this. Steve Jobs talked about not being able to connect the dots, except in retrospect. And I, and I subscribe to that and his life was a bit of a random walk, but that we're guided by some central beam of,

46:25.410 --> 46:51.358
of uniqueness. Robert Greene, when he was on the podcast, talks about that. Your beam is more narrow, it seems. And the propeller behind that beam is high RPM. That's very clear. And what I'm not hearing here is like, yeah, at one point I paused and wondered whether or not I wanted to be here wrestling in the Naval Academy or even

46:52.322 --> 47:22.110
what I might do when I get out? Am I going to work for an investment firm? What am I going to do? Your horizon, it seems to be about 24 hours at that point. Yeah, I hope not anymore, but at that point. No, at that point. I mean, I'm no psychologist, but it just seems like you're, it's not like you're playing checkers, but you're optimizing for a fairly short horizon. There's no question that's right. And the other part that was probably the most important to me, Andrew, was the

47:22.530 --> 47:50.846
the person or the group. Because this is going to sound very arrogant, but when I got to, I'm going to this prep school, I'm going to the Naval Academy. I think on day one, I'm going to literally meet the cream of the crop in the country. And that was not the case. And it was not the case at the Naval Academy. And frankly, it wasn't the case in the teams either. Like, I'm not saying I'm better than anybody, but I thought every single person when I got to the Naval Academy was going to be entirely focused on

47:51.330 --> 48:21.278
whatever our mission was, and I didn't even know what my mission was there, right? I just knew I was gonna be told what Wright looks like. And Doug, not only did I meet him in high school and have the luck of having him as a teammate and a mentor, for me, he is what Wright looked like. So a focused beam and a propeller running at high RPM with the Wright, you know, quote unquote, swim buddy, so to speak, was literally all I cared about. That was it. Everything else was white noise.

48:21.666 --> 48:51.646
Were there other interests at the time? I mean, presumably you listen to music every once in a while, but I mean, I would whatever, but didn't fall in love with it. Didn't feel the need to pursue anything else, learn an instrument, do anything else. It was, it was, it was a, it was that narrow beam. So you met your wife in 96. Sophomore year at the Naval Academy. Yep. Uh, and was she as driven? Is she as driven? I mean, she's obviously a very talented swimmer. I'm presumably works hard as well. Um,

48:52.354 --> 49:22.142
It's kind of interesting. I didn't realize until a few years ago that the both of you were military. Yeah, she definitely just different, different driven, way smarter, way more. It's obviously not one to one for men and women, but way more successful by gradient standards. She's in the Navy Hall of Fame. She was Patriot League swimming champ. She was on junior national triathlon team when she was 20, I think.

49:23.554 --> 49:47.774
Really talented in every regard. Ninth in our class, I think. First female graduate, number one female graduate, our class. Tell me more about that. How's that work? You have a, I don't even know exactly how the grading, first of all, her grades are, her academic success is just remarkable. And then you get a military grade and you get a physical grade, not for your athletics, I don't think, but it's like,

49:48.034 --> 50:16.190
your PRT scores, which is your physical readiness test, all this military stuff you do, you get this other cluster of a grade that goes along with your academic grades. And she was number nine in the class and the first female graduate based on that cluster of grading. And, I mean, she's an amazing person. Was her success in academics and swimming, was that part of what drew you to her? No. No.

50:16.450 --> 50:46.206
No, she was just nice and, you know. I didn't really care about the achievement. It certainly sounds like I care about achievement because of the narrow focus, but it wasn't really that. You know, she was just really normal in a group of a lot of abnormal people, frankly. Like, there's some kooks at these schools, you know. And I'm probably in that category. I don't know. But everybody's just really different there. You have this athlete group. I mean, you know, Andrew. I mean, you went to –

50:46.338 --> 51:16.158
Stanford. I mean, some of the, you know, the group of Naval Academy and West Point, like these schools who produce like the Rhodes Scholar level person, like that cluster of group, like at Navy, I remember, they're super impressive. I mean, and then there's the rest of us like doing our best, getting pretty good grades and stuff, but there's very different groups inside, you know, the school. Yeah. Yeah. I looked at some of my colleagues, like a former guest on this podcast, Allie Crum, you know, she's incredible scientist, was a

51:16.546 --> 51:44.574
division one gymnast and is a licensed clinical psychologist. Also maintains a healthy relationship with children in the home. Like I just go, who are these people? You know, it's, I mean, you know, every once in a while we talk about the person with the quote unquote extra gear, you know, like some people just seem to have that extra gear and I don't want to take anything away from Allie or anyone else's incredible work ethic that goes with what people perceive as an extra gear. Who knows if they have an extra gear or not.

51:44.802 --> 52:12.254
I always just wanna know what their parents did. And it turns out Allie's parents, I hope I have this right, but recollection of this is that her mother ran a theater group and her father was a martial arts teacher. So there's nothing that speaks to academics per se. And I find that really important to me and to highlight because I think people hearing this conversation and hear about people like Allie's and other examples like that,

52:12.450 --> 52:38.878
You think, oh yeah, you gotta come from an academic family to end up at a top tier institution or to win a Nobel Prize. In fact, there are so many exceptions to that, or you have to be a natural athlete or be born with some genetic gift or some extra gear, as it were, in order to succeed. But I think so much of success is the thing that you seem to operationalize really quickly, which is,

52:39.746 --> 53:05.630
to really focus on that 24 hour horizon and where one has seen failure to just keep going. I mean, a big part of it is just to keep going, but also to make sure that you're continuing to go in a direction that is adaptive and functional. Because imagine had you not found wrestling and you had gotten into some group where the metrics of success were around,

53:06.018 --> 53:32.414
stealing weed or doing something which back then was highly illegal, now is varying levels of legality. But you know, where the points came back for effort in domains of life that could take you down into the gutter. And you see this. So I'm convinced that the work ethic is the fundamental piece, but there has to be that rudder. And the rudder has to be pointed in the right direction. So along those lines, you meet Bridget. Yeah. And was it instantaneous? No, we kind of had a friendship first.

53:32.962 --> 54:02.206
I felt like, at least, we've discussed this. I mean, I instantaneously enjoyed her company. So I met Bridget in February of sophomore year. I was on the campus of Naval Academy, it's called The Yard. I was on The Yard all winter because the wrestling season isn't the shittiest time ever, right? It crosses over the holidays. You have to make weight during Thanksgiving. You have to make weight during Christmas. We were on campus, on The Yard, and it was easily waist-deep snow, and we were doing two-a-day practices.

54:02.338 --> 54:27.358
Everybody else is home on vacation. That winter, I considered leaving. And thank goodness for no cell phones and stuff because I didn't know how to leave. You considered leaving the Naval Academy. But it didn't have anything to do with the Naval Academy, really. It had everything to do with that moment. I was miserable. I wrestled 190 my freshman year, and Doug graduated from

54:28.322 --> 54:57.470
he was the 177 pounder. So sophomore year I dropped into his spot. I went down to 177. Fighting weight for me is like 193. But you know, back then Andrew, lifting a lot, I was 210 to 215 in the off season. And I cut to 177 sophomore year. And I was just generally miserable. And if it was easy to leave, I probably would have. And then I met Bridget in February and I was like, fuck it, I'll stay.

54:58.850 --> 55:26.302
She's better than this place anyway. Having followed my high school girlfriend off to college and not gone to college when I got there, I just lived in the parking lot outside her dorm room. I can relate. I probably wouldn't be sitting here today were it not for Eleni. So at what point did you decide you wanted to aim for the SEAL teams? It's a great question. I mean, things, you know, as compared to...

55:27.298 --> 55:57.150
I had a gunnery sergeant in the Marine Corps at prep school who I thought, these are back to the first people you meet in this environment, Gunny Flynn. And he was great. Like he was super hard on us, but I obviously kind of love that. And I thought I was gonna go into the Marine Corps and Doug wanted to go into the Marine Corps. I'm a freshman at the Naval Academy. He's my wrestling partner. Doug could literally tell me to jump off of a building. As long as he came with me, I'd do it no problem and enjoy it all the way down. Doug was going into the Marine Corps. I thought I was gonna go into the Marine Corps

55:58.082 --> 56:24.702
and I did a summer training in Quantico between freshman and sophomore year. And it was okay, it was good, but I didn't love it. And I met a couple other guys who were gonna compete for spots in the SEAL teams who were years ahead of me, but to answer your question, junior year, you can sign up and say, I wanna start competing for a billet. We had 16 spots in my class. I think there's 32 spots these days.

56:26.018 --> 56:54.270
You know, the force has grown since 9-11 obviously. And I wanna say maybe 150 or so people, they put you through this weekend, overnight, two day, hell two day things at Navy. Some people quit. I don't know how many go to what we used to call mini-Buds in the summer between junior and senior year. You go out to Coronado and Bud's instructors, they still have it. It's called something different. You spend two weeks

56:54.562 --> 57:21.374
at the BUDS compound, they run you through a mini program. And so- BUDS for the, some folks listening to this won't know the acronym. The acronym is Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL, school. That's our school in Coronado. It's a screening process for who gets in, who doesn't. Yeah. And when you're at the Naval Academy, it's obviously different than guys coming into the enlisted ranks. You have this pool of people, 150-ish guys say they want to go. Sometime junior year, they run you through this weekend pretty hard at Navy.

57:22.530 --> 57:48.958
because we have SEALs stationed at the Naval Academy. And then I'm just going to guess that goes from 150 to 80. Maybe 80 guys go to the summer program in Coronado when you're still, you know, a midshipman at the Naval Academy. I've never, maybe people have quit mini buds. I don't know. But I don't know if I really saw anybody quit the two weeks we're out in Coronado. And then you get, you know, graded on your performance and stuff. And then you come back,

57:49.154 --> 58:18.014
senior year and you go through a series of interviews with a bunch of SEALs who come out and do interviews and you don't really know what you're doing. And then they select down, I don't want to again overdo it, but it's probably seven, I don't know, maybe 50 or 60 qualified guys. They select you down to 16. And so to answer your question about when I got interested was when I knew I didn't want to go in the Marine Corps, I never ever had the Top Gun fever thing.

58:18.722 --> 58:46.078
I wasn't interested in flying. I just wasn't interested in anything else, but something super physical. And that seemed like the best, the next best thing. And because I grew up in New Orleans and spent a lot of time in the water, that wasn't intimidating. That screens a lot of people out, obviously. Yeah. And got selected in the group of 16 and was at Bud's after graduation, you know, a couple of months after graduation. There's been a lot put...

58:47.010 --> 59:15.646
out into the world around Buds. People have seen the log carrying and the boat carrying and the screaming and the set, screaming of the instructors and the running and the clasped arms in the water and hell week, no sleep and on and on. It's obviously tough. It calls 85% of the people that go out there thinking that they are the absolute last person who would ever quit, ring the bell, so to speak.

59:16.674 --> 59:44.414
You obviously got through. A while back, you mentioned to me three things that you think predict whether or not somebody is going to get through BUDS. And before you tell us what these are, I will just tell people that, yes, of course, you made it through BUDS successfully and went into the teams, a very successful career in the teams. But you've also been a BUDS instructor, so you've been on the other side of the equation too. What are those three things?

59:45.250 --> 01:00:15.038
Yeah, this was, as you know, this was very anecdotal, but it lined up. When I was back there in 05 as an instructor, Andrew, I feel like we're not scientists, right? But I feel like we tried every correlating data pull that we could pull from pull-ups to run times to you name it, to regions of the country that people grow up near water. At least back then, nothing correlated. And so I was a first phase OIC, officer in charge.

01:00:15.522 --> 01:00:45.054
And so our team in first phase, we can talk about what that is in detail if you want to, but first phase is in charge of Hell Week. Hell Week's in the first two months of training. And a couple of the guys said, all this bullshit about this can get you through, that can get you through. I bet that every single person we talk to out here on the grinder has one of these three things. They were a varsity athlete in high school or college, their parents are divorced, or they got suspended from school. I guarantee it. And we would walk around the grinder

01:00:45.506 --> 01:01:12.894
and ask. And I mean, this isn't gonna pass an independent review board, but it's gotta be 90 to 95%. So that's incredible because so much has been made of buds and hell week. And just to just fill in a few of the blanks for those that aren't familiar, hell week is what? It's five nights, no sleep. You get an hour or a couple minutes on one day, but you're basically in constant movement for about a week. You are. And that's when most people

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:42.270
voluntarily ring the bell. And most of them do it before Wednesday. Okay. And I know it's got chaotic components, guns going off, blasts. It's got hard work, boring components. People trying to make it through who have no sense of how long a run is going to last or what's going to happen. And you hear all this stuff like, okay, you just don't quit or you just go meal to meal. But what you just described is really interesting. Let's break those three things down because playing a varsity sport,

01:01:43.266 --> 01:02:10.974
has certain elements. Having divorced parents has certain elements and getting suspended in school has certain elements. Let's start with divorced parents first. Because varsity sport, I think we can probably just quickly say, okay, there's structure, you have to listen to somebody, you have to be able to push yourself, you have to have some level of physical competence. Coachable. Coachable mental competence, work with others. So there's something there.

01:02:11.074 --> 01:02:39.486
And you presumably have to go through junior varsity to get there. So there's some oomph and required in any event. But the divorced parents piece is what's surprising to me, still is. You have divorced parents, so do I. Divorces occur for any number of different reasons. What in the world do you think is the consequence of or of a divorced household that would predict

01:02:39.586 --> 01:03:08.126
so well, at least in this back of the envelope measurement that you made, but as an instructor, that people would get through this excruciatingly difficult period of time? For me, it was one thing specifically. I felt like I was alone if I didn't have the team. So I don't know what it would be for other people, but I was like, if I don't have this team, then what team do I have? So I'm not leaving.

01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:38.110
you could crank up the cold and misery as high as you fucking want, but I'm not leaving. Yeah, that hits deep. I didn't do buds. I didn't even know what the SEAL teams were, but I certainly know the feeling of looking outside of the household for a sense of family and belonging and the feeling that like I'd much rather, like from almost from a place of joy, like I'd much rather die for these people, hopefully not with,

01:03:38.274 --> 01:04:03.966
people but much rather die trying to save others and to do well in that than to quit yeah yeah that's that's a powerful thing that you just shine light on i don't think of the hundreds of interviews with team guys x team guys buds instructors etc that are out there i don't think anyone's ever highlighted that i don't think i was aware of it then andrew but i just you know again it's in it's in retrospect

01:04:04.418 --> 01:04:33.054
the retrospect is in large part what we're here for. To go a little deeper on that, I think that a lot of people have challenging homes. The parents aren't necessarily divorced. And we're talking, of course, about trying to understand the human spirit, certainly not accomplishments per se, but the human spirit. So I think that a lot of people, especially nowadays, they look to their home life. And if, you know, God willing, they had a great home life

01:04:33.826 --> 01:05:02.718
that is the base. It's like the touchstone for them that they can return to. But for a lot of people, even people who go home for the holidays or who touch in with their parents, whether or not they're divorced or not, they don't feel like that family unit is really a solid thing. Maybe they're in a place, I see this a lot of, where like they're the parent, they had to grow up taking care of the parents. I see that a lot. On both the male side and the female side, I see that. So you're saying that

01:05:03.586 --> 01:05:29.086
One strong predictor of getting through is a feeling of people want essentially making it their almost like biological identity to get through. It was certainly the case for me. I mean, when I got – again, I don't really like to overdo these things because it tends to feed the mythos a little. But when I got to Bud's, Andrew, like when I got to the Naval Academy, I had a very strong sense of this is my chance.

01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:59.454
you know, you develop over the years and you spend time thinking about this and having mentors. When I got there, that was very much my first time of, you better bring the nastiest shit on the planet because I'm not leaving here. Like, it's just not, I'm not, I'm just not going, you know? And there's a Navy bit to it too. Like I didn't want to do anything else in the Navy. So back to fear, I was afraid I would get stuck doing a job I didn't like.

01:05:59.938 --> 01:06:29.342
But there's some, people are not wrong about buds. There's some very difficult days where you do start to wonder, like, is this really worth it? And I never once thought about quitting. It never crossed my mind because I just had these other things that I really had to do for myself and my life or else I felt like I was gonna have nothing. And so, again, I don't think operating out of fear is particularly adaptive.

01:06:29.922 --> 01:06:57.726
Sometimes the bit in your teeth is useful. Yeah, certainly in my own life, I could say getting real scared about being 19 and essentially realizing I'm not good at anything. I'm not good at anything. And I was terrible at a lot of things. And some of those things were taking me down a dangerous path. I'm grateful for the fear piece. It scruffed me. And let's talk about the suspended in school. Yep.

01:06:58.370 --> 01:07:22.206
Um, he's, uh, first of all, that implies getting caught. Yes. Uh, not just misbehaving, but getting caught. Um, yeah. What do you think that's about? So we're really talking about a sense of rebellion against authority or the system that one finds themselves in. Which is super important for our line of work. Like for me, again, I can only speak for myself. For me, it was the wild fuck you factor. Like you have to

01:07:23.458 --> 01:07:47.582
There's just a nasty reality of the work we had to do. You know, I was in from 98 until 2011. In the SEAL teams. In the SEAL teams from 98 until 2011. Everybody knows what was happening between 9-11 and then. It's not that it didn't stop happening. I know, you know, from my own experience from 03 through 2010 was extremely intense. And, um,

01:07:51.010 --> 01:08:19.070
Obviously, the military has rules and we need rules. And you follow the laws of armed conflict and you follow the rules of engagement. There's no question about that ever. But the shit that happens to you out in the field for real does not follow any pattern. And so if you are a complete, you know, non suspended from school rule follower, I'm not saying you won't be successful. I'm sure plenty of people are.

01:08:19.746 --> 01:08:48.958
But in our line of work, if you ask people, most of them had a weird streak as they were coming up. Like they have a little bit of a side eye when somebody tells them this is how stuff is. Like maybe it's like that. But you don't know that. And where it really became clear for me, Andrew, was like at every stage in your development, you're still looking for what right looks like. And when I was – I'm now a Naval Academy graduate. Not that that means anything special. But I'm smart enough –

01:08:49.569 --> 01:09:19.166
I'm now in my 20s. I'm at Bud's. And I have this recollection later, like people are always telling stories about the teams. And when you're a new student at Bud's, you kind of believe everything the instructors tell you because it's pretty impressive shit. And then you find out later when I checked into SEAL Team 3 and you actually start to understand the arc of the job. It's like all these guys were telling training stories. Those weren't real combat stories. They never said...

01:09:19.841 --> 01:09:48.830
that was a story from training. And so my point is like, what you hope guys are getting it now, but what we didn't get a lot of was the real story in a sense. Meaning, I will say definitively, my first combat deployment was 03 when we invaded Iraq. I was a platoon commander when we invaded Iraq. And I remember within a week of being in that situation, thinking not one single instructor

01:09:49.122 --> 01:10:18.494
the experience to mentor and coach me on this not one and so you have to go back to that wild suspended fuck you factor mindset like all your silly rules about how the military works none of that shit's happening out here like all this other stuff is happening that doesn't have anything to do with your training manuals except for the things you don't violate which is to your best of your ability stuff happens but

01:10:18.978 --> 01:10:46.718
the rules of engagement and laws of armed conflict. Everything else is a toss-up. The tactics aren't. That's not a toss-up. But you know what I mean. Like the environment is completely chaotic. It's a new sport. It's a brand new sport that no one coached you on. And it's high risk, high consequence for you and your teammates, but also for the other side. I mean, every 15 seconds is a new consequential decision.

01:10:48.706 --> 01:11:17.438
Yeah, cuz you obviously don't wanna kill civilians on the other side either. Of course not, yeah. So you obviously get through buds. You probably weren't surprised given your mindset, probably weren't surprised. No, I wasn't surprised. At this point, I'm maybe building a little self confidence and just operate out of fear. But happy, presumably. Yeah, yeah. And I feel obligated to ask, well, I'm just curious to ask that.

01:11:17.922 --> 01:11:46.782
You know, you've been in a system of military for a long time. Is there a bigger pull of patriotism there? Or that's just, it's there. But, I mean, are you thinking about country or are you thinking about team? You think about the day? Yeah, I mean, at this point, you know, I'm fully indoctrinated in a sense. You know, the Naval Academy really does give you a sense of, again, bigness. And you meet people from World War II and Vietnam. And, you know, an amazing guy, which, you know, we can...

01:11:47.234 --> 01:12:16.862
I wasn't around when he was coming up, but Colonel John Ripley is a guy who won the Navy Cross in Vietnam. The book, The Bridge of Dong Ha is about him. He knew my, this is back to my uncle Jim who introduced, he and my uncle Jim were buddies and I met him, he's since passed away. I met Colonel Ripley when I was a plebe at the Naval Academy. I work with one of his sons now, friend, teammate, mentor. He's a great guy.

01:12:18.210 --> 01:12:44.606
Colonel Ripley, he's a legend. Like this guy's a Navy Cross winner, should have won the Congressional Medal of Honor by all accounts. If you read the book, the Bridge of Donha, you are going to have no ability to understand why he's not dead. And these are the kind of people you meet. So back to the patriotism thing. By the time I was in the teams, I knew where I was sort of in this ecosystem of

01:12:45.570 --> 01:13:08.990
admittedly though what I didn't really have Andrew because it I mean I love the country of course but it wasn't again I didn't grow up with a dad who was like you know this was always in our house or it just wasn't that big of a thing this this came for me after 9-11 obviously but yes the patriotism and the importance of the jobs there but when I remember checking in a seal team three what

01:13:10.626 --> 01:13:38.942
What emerged very quickly for me because we had Vietnam vets in the training cell at Tilt Team 3 and just some amazing people. What I realized right away was, okay, playtime is completely over. And that was very useful, like early lesson. Not that anyone was fucking around in buds, like you know it's serious. But you meet a guy like Master Chief Martin who's got 100 combat missions from Vietnam, he's about to retire. He was like the third person I met when I checked into the team.

01:13:39.458 --> 01:14:07.454
And you suddenly are like a kid again where there's just no fucking around. So you're in the teams, presumably liking the work. Loved it. Loving the team component. It's hard. It's unpredictable. And that's part of the fun. It's amazing. Yeah. The job's amazing. You do a number of different deployments. And at some point...

01:14:08.034 --> 01:14:32.414
you get called to try out for the tier one, tier one division within the, within the SEAL teams. Maybe just explain a little bit of what tier one means. And, you know, we don't want to speak in code here, but we, you know, just got to inform people that there are levels within the teams. And that, yeah, tell us what tier one is. Yeah. Well, I'll just refer to a special mission unit. It's probably the easiest. Yeah.

01:14:32.930 --> 01:15:02.174
We have a bunch of teams on the East and West Coast, as a lot of people know nowadays, this shit was not public knowledge years ago. Yeah, so you've got these different units within the SEAL teams. Yeah, so you have to raise your hand. I was 10 years in, Andrew, I had been platoon commander during the invasion of Iraq. We came to Monterey, I went to school, I went back to be a BUDD instructor. It was 10 years I felt like it was time to take my shot. It's a little risky because it's hard to make it through.

01:15:02.818 --> 01:15:28.254
you know, green team and stuff at the special mission unit. It's a nine-month advanced training program. You're 10 years into your career. You're not 22 anymore. And not everyone gets called the green team. Not everyone can go. You can't say, I want to go. I want to try out. You can say you want to try out, and you do a pre-screener. Okay. So the command training staff, I'll call it the command for purposes of this conversation because I'm familiar with that term for us. The command training staff comes out. They put you through all this stuff.

01:15:28.514 --> 01:15:50.526
Some of it's psychological, some of it's physiological. I don't think we did a blood test, but they checked. The trainers checked everything on me, which I thought this is actually a description of why the unit's tier one. I was, even in the pre-screening, it was the first time, the way I joke about it is like I really felt like I was doing what was in the brochure. Like it was real varsity stuff, you know.

01:15:51.874 --> 01:16:18.366
I'm presaging a later conversation that we'll get to, but at this point, had you ever sat down with a psychologist and done a therapy session? That was no therapy, but I sat down with a psychologist because they put us through the battery, the Neo PIR, the Raven, stuff like that. They're asking you, how do you sleep at night? How do you feel? What do you dream about? How much do you drink? And you say two beers a week. And you're lying. Everyone's lying. Yeah. But now it might be two beers a week. Now it's zero. Zero. Right. Yeah.

01:16:18.722 --> 01:16:48.542
But yeah, so it was good screening process. Like I was like, oh shit, these guys are not messing around. This is exactly what I wanted to do. And the physical tests ramp up. And coincidentally, I worked for him later, still friends with him now. On my interview board was Britt Slabinski, who won the Congressional Medal of Honor. Britt was on my interview board and he's a great guy. And so yeah, then you just wait. And if you get picked up, you go out to the East Coast and you're really rolling the dice because I was on the West Coast

01:16:48.962 --> 01:17:17.534
You move your whole family, sell your house. You may not have to sell your house, but we did. And you move, and you're going to do a nine-month advanced training program at the command just to get into a tactical unit, you know, which we call squadrons. And the best way tactically for me to describe the difference, and look, my time at Team 3 was amazing. I'm not diminishing it. But let me just use free fall, military free fall for anybody who's, you know, even done civilian free fall. So... It's jumping out of place. Jumping.

01:17:18.274 --> 01:17:47.518
So if we go to the drop zone and we go jumping, right? FAA regulations have you jump at 12,999 feet, because as soon as you go above 13,000, you have to use supplemental oxygen, which is not a huge deal, but it's a pain in the ass for the airplane to have it. And so 99% of all your jumps, well, at any standard drop zone, your civilian jumps are gonna be below 13 grand. For all of our jumping at SEAL Team 3 is below 13 grand. It just makes the training more efficient. And you'll jump during the daytime,

01:17:47.682 --> 01:18:15.614
maybe a little night jumping, you'll probably have some lights for safety. And if you look out of the airplane, you would be able to see the orange T on the drop zone, right? That's your standard jump profile. Maybe you'll jump with some weight. You'll certainly jump with your weapon, probably your helmet, but not all your jumps, because you're bringing guys from zero to be able to do tactical military free fall as a group. When you go to the command,

01:18:16.482 --> 01:18:45.982
Your jumps are from 25,000 feet. You do 30 minutes of pre-breathing on oxygen, helmet, night vision, zero lights, an attack board that has your navigation system on it, 100 pounds of gear, your weapon, your oxygen, all your shit, and 45 dudes piled up in a C-17. And you drop miles away from the drop zone because your overground speed at 25,000 feet is hauling ass.

01:18:46.114 --> 01:19:15.198
you know, because of the wind. And if you take your hands out of your gloves at 25,000 feet, it's curtains. Like you're not going to be able to use your fingers because it's so cold. And you jump from way away, obviously, and all your jump is completely blacked out. Everybody turns IR lights on, their helmets and their infrared lights so you can see through night vision. And you got to fly that canopy multiple, multiple miles and land everybody on a drop zone. You know, that's, if you take every tactical thing we do and,

01:19:15.714 --> 01:19:42.942
expand the same way you would expand free fall. That's the difference at the command, which is, look, I was, I want to own this. When I was at team three, because you think about this, I had many, many moments where I was thinking, oh, fuck it, man, those guys aren't that much different. Like we're, we're super high end, right? And we are. And then when I got there, I was like, this is, this is another level.

01:19:43.202 --> 01:20:11.102
What percentage of people that go to green team get through and get sort of? I think I had 65 in my class. You don't drop that many. Maybe 10 guys didn't make it or something. Maybe 15-ish. So then you were – why do they call it tier one? No idea. It must have some official reason. Because if you go into like real documentation, Andrew, like there's echelons in –

01:20:11.650 --> 01:20:41.406
You know, this command is echelon this. This command is echelon this. In the military, Congress sets end strength numbers. It says the Navy, you get at the one time, because it took some class, the Navy had like 355,000 people. And that's the Navy's end strength. And they have to distribute those numbers across everybody in the Navy. So I don't know why it's called tier one, but I think it has a, you know, has a reason. So you got through. You were accepted. And...

01:20:41.730 --> 01:21:08.446
then you're doing very different sorts of things than you were doing previously. Very. So my understanding is this is largely counter-terrorist work. So all the work in the military and SEAL teams is high risk, high consequence, but now it's special operations, as the name implies, where things have to be worked out on a –

01:21:08.994 --> 01:21:38.814
on a case-by-case basis. It's highly unusual. It was unusual before, but now it's highly unusual circumstances. What was it like to be there? Did you like that family? I loved it. It was the best place to work. And this is 2000? This is 06 through 2011 for me. Okay. So it's post 9-11 through 2011. Yep. Okay. So I'm sure a lot happened, and most of which we...

01:21:39.298 --> 01:22:06.878
and won't discuss, and that's not what's important here. But clearly you met and worked with some amazing individuals. I happen to know because we've spoken before and we have some common friends in that arena that you had both the privilege of doing this work in this really important wartime, but also the unfortunate experience of

01:22:07.746 --> 01:22:32.734
being close to and working with quite a lot of people that were killed. How many? So, I mean, I don't know why I did this or why anyone does it. It's way over 40, but I try not to over-affiliate myself with a larger group than I actually knew. But the people that I personally knew, Andrew, it's exactly 40.

01:22:34.434 --> 01:23:04.350
And we could spend probably weeks detailing how impressive each and every one of those people was in their individual cases. This is perhaps an opportunity to put a call out. There's a wonderful book, I think an important book that isn't so well known in the array of quote unquote military and SEAL books, which is the book about Adam Brown, a fearless book. I heard they're going to make it into a movie, but what I...

01:23:04.514 --> 01:23:33.534
What I like about the book is actually has very little to do with the SEAL team. Totally. That's the best thing. Is that Adam had a serious, serious problem with addiction that he masked at times and it came back to pull him under various times while he was in the teams. And I know you worked with Adam and you're close. I was on my green team, yeah. Yeah, so that's a great book for anyone that wants a different sort of book. It's really about addiction and family and his discovery of

01:23:33.730 --> 01:24:02.558
the path out of all that. His tenacity is incredible. It's an awesome, awesome book. Human, about an awesome, awesome human. So you do those years. And then, what happens when 40 people close to you die? I have to imagine involves that you get pretty good, unfortunately, at,

01:24:04.194 --> 01:24:33.886
taking what each and every one of those is a tragedy and just continuing. So let's just talk about that for a bit, if you're willing. So guys are getting shot and blown up and you're close with them to say the least. And what was your role in the aftermath? Like, what do you do? You go to a funeral, you toast a few beers and then you go back to work?

01:24:34.978 --> 01:25:04.734
I mean, it's, that's kind of, you know, in the most simplistic terms, Andrew, that is exactly what happens. There's obviously, you know, a lot more that goes on. But if you script the diary, so to speak, it's, it wasn't, you know, a funeral every three months, but on average, if I averaged out, because I've done this in, you know, excavating the last few years,

01:25:05.666 --> 01:25:33.054
We were at a funeral memorial effectively every 90 days and in that time period. But it wasn't obviously, you know, that simple. Like for me and our family, Doug was my first super close teammate killed and it wasn't in the teams, right? I'm now at the command. I was back from Afghanistan, from Kandahar. This is way before the Marines built up

01:25:33.922 --> 01:26:02.878
100 kilometers west of Kandahar. We were operating six of us with like 180 Afghans kind of the wild west back then. And Doug was killed that summer of 07. And I got a phone call from a friend. I was standing in my kitchen at Virginia Beach. And it was like, like the whole scaffolding of the world was just gone.

01:26:05.282 --> 01:26:33.918
Because at that age, and here I am, like, I'm some kid. I was in my 30s. But I'm thinking, you know, things get more and more serious as you go, like at that time. But when Doug was killed, and I was at Paul Baroness's funeral, and, you know, we came up to Annapolis. He was living in Annapolis because he was working. It's now been publicly released, which is nice for Pam because she can talk about it more. He was working at the agency. And...

01:26:36.066 --> 01:27:04.126
When after his funeral and just the days around that, and then I go back to work. And what I mentioned earlier about Doug and what I knew about him just as an operator, he had been a company commander in Fallujah. He was on the front page of the LA Times. Like Tony Perry is a reporter in San Diego. He was in Fallujah following Doug. The guy was, and Doug is not a, like a public people. People were just attracted to him to tell his story. I have so many stories that I heard later from

01:27:04.226 --> 01:27:32.414
his bosses, his regimental commander, told stories about his unit in Fallujah, his sergeant major and his amazing guy. I've talked to him about what went on in Fallujah. Doug is just a fucking legend. I mean, he was awesome. And the dominant thought after his funeral was, if things, it's not that you don't think they're serious, and I mean just about life, Andrew. It wasn't just about combat action and hard deployments. It was about if Doug can be killed

01:27:33.218 --> 01:28:00.702
all fucking bets are off. They're all off. Like if I didn't respect the rules before and didn't think society was particularly ordered in a way that I respected, you know, shit that I think is made up. I knew when Doug was killed that it's all fucking made up. Like he was supposed to be the immortal one. And if he's not, none of us are.

01:28:01.826 --> 01:28:31.422
Like everything has to be reevaluated. You know, how old was I? I was 32. And you've got kids at this point. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Ollie wasn't born yet. My youngest. Because you now have three boys. Yep. Three boys. 21, 18, and 14. And the older two were born. My middle son was two at the time. Did it occur to you at the point when Doug was killed or maybe some other point that, you know, at some point you could die?

01:28:31.810 --> 01:28:59.070
Oh, I mean, that's what I mean, Andrew. Like I, you know, personal work and therapy afterwards, it was then that I started looking over my shoulder, just in general. Like everything was suddenly, like has to be watched with a vigilant eye. Something that close friends, close male friends of mine have told me, these are friends that are married with kids.

01:28:59.266 --> 01:29:27.774
and I've heard this from people that were in the military and as well as those that weren't, was that it was very important to them to marry somebody who were they to die, they knew their kids would be well taken care of. Oh, that one's not even, there's no question about that. Yeah, so that was like a primary criteria. And I think in your line of work, I mean, that must be especially important because the probability of

01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:56.350
dying is, well, let's face it, is much higher. As my sister, who doesn't like sharks, once told me, she said, you know, the best way to not get eaten by a shark is never go in the ocean. You know, there is a way to limiting probabilities. She'll swim in the ocean a little bit. But the point being that when you're in the military and you're shoot, move, and communicate is a big part of the job description. And the enemy is also taught to shoot, move, and communicate that there's a decent probability that

01:29:56.450 --> 01:30:25.662
you could die. So did you ever think, okay, well, if I die, my kids are okay because Bridget's solid. Or were you still just operating on this 24-hour schedule that you had adopted way back in the seventh grade? No, I think, well, maybe I'd have to ask her that question. I think I was backed away from the 24-hour ledge a little bit. I knew that the boys obviously would be

01:30:26.370 --> 01:30:55.230
taken care of with my wife. Like that was never, it never crossed my mind probably until you just asked the question. That was almost just like table stakes. Back to this adaptive but maladaptive behavior. When Doug was killed, I just realized I had to work even harder to try to stay alive. Because if you met the guy, there is, I'm going to say it probably multiple, there is not a fucking human on the planet

01:30:56.258 --> 01:31:25.438
that was as tough and as focused and as hyper dialed in to how to do the job a hundred percent effectively as he was. And it happened to him, you know, and I just never, it's almost embarrassing Andrew to say, I'd never thought about it like that until Doug was killed. And, and yet, and I'm not challenging that at all. Of course, uh,

01:31:25.538 --> 01:31:54.686
I mean, life, circumstances, the other team gets a vote too. Totally. Right? I mean, somebody can be seemingly indestructible, oh so capable and talented, and get T-boned at an intersection and die. Totally. Right? Like that. Yeah. We've known people like that. All of us, you know, you hear these things. That's why they're called tragedies. Yeah, we just, like, to put it in context, we have to remember is part of the beauty of taking a young person

01:31:55.362 --> 01:32:21.982
taking all the ingredients that a person comes into special operations, pick your service. I'm not, I'm agnostic. I mean, some of my best buddies are Army and Marine Corps. Like I'm agnostic to the service head is when you end up at a certain point, like, and you look back, you realize for 10 or 15 years, I've been indoctrinated in a very adaptive way to believe that I'm immortal. Because if you didn't,

01:32:23.938 --> 01:32:52.798
certainly wouldn't jump out of aircraft at 25,000 feet with no lights and you for hell for sure wouldn't go into some of these fucking towns we go into and end up in these firefights like you have some weird I'll speak for myself I was entirely convinced that I couldn't be killed and I just because I was in some way Andrew convinced that our training was so good that that shit wouldn't happen to us let's take a step back for a second and acknowledge that

01:32:53.570 --> 01:33:20.478
all around that set of statements, which is that I think most people can think of the government and the training programs as honing the body, but it's probably not lost on you at this point in your life that you were a weapon. Your mind became a weapon, right? Your body became a weapon. You were a weapon of the military

01:33:20.898 --> 01:33:48.094
the inside out and in the statement you just made encapsulates that um and that weapon honed itself for a long time but then that's what the military is it creates weapons and of out of humans and i'm not demonizing the military whatsoever i want to be very clear i realize that statement could be construed differently but um but that mindset encapsulates that so um so with the other guys i want to make sure i finish your question so it started with doug and then you know

01:33:48.802 --> 01:34:18.302
know what direction you want to go here specifically but then it just kept going Andrew right like at that time Doug was 07 and then we went to Iraq in the winter of 07 08 which was complete mayhem and the troop was I mean my my troop in the winter of 07 08 were like fucking superheroes and a guy named Tommy Valentine was the troop chief and we got home and

01:34:18.594 --> 01:34:44.670
he was killed in a parachute accident. After all that shit we went through. Badger, a guy named Mark Carter was killed in that deployment. We got home and Tommy was killed in a parachute accident. And me and a guy named Dutch, we went up to Minnesota to notify Tommy's parents and his sister and his brother. And we're not, the Navy calls them CACOs, like casualty assistance officers. These are jobs in the military.

01:34:45.026 --> 01:35:12.606
you're trained to do stuff. You know, one of the things that's amazing about us is if a guy gets killed, we send a team guy there. But think about the team guy. Like, it's great for the family that you send the team guy, but we don't know shit about sitting with a family who's about to be notified that their son, in this case of Tommy, was killed. Britt went to Christina's house, his lab, Britt Slabinski, he went to Christina's house and me and Dutch went up to Minnesota. And...

01:35:14.434 --> 01:35:43.326
I'm shaking right now, like I was shaking the whole drive. We had to get to International Falls all way up north. The Valentines are incredible people. And I mean, notifying a family was just, it was brutal. And so this is, this is, this is 08. And then it just keeps coming. It's Nate and it's Mike and it's Lance and it's extortion in 2011. And in the middle of that,

01:35:44.098 --> 01:36:13.246
Adam gets killed, right? Like tons of people know about extortion because it was one helicopter, obviously full. Well, maybe we just briefly want to mention that was August 2011, as I recall. Yes. Yeah. August of 11. Yeah. So, but in 2010, Adam is killed. And I got a phone call and I wasn't best friend. I mean, Adam had some very close friends as a command that I don't want to make some, anybody give the impression that like me and Adam were boys. We were,

01:36:13.474 --> 01:36:41.566
We knew each other well, right? We went through green team together. He was in a different squadron though, so you sort of get separated a little. And I got a phone call in the middle of the night from one of my buddies who's still in, who is another legend. And I answered the phone and it's midnight. I knew something was wrong. And we were kind of in this pattern then. And you're like, actually a few of the commands were, like our partner command and a bunch of other guys we work with in other units.

01:36:41.986 --> 01:37:11.646
was a hard time. Like guys were fighting hard overseas. And, um, that just comes with the consequences we know, you know, and I get the phone call in the middle of the night. I'm like, and so this guy tells me, you know, get your uniform. You need to come in. Something happened. I'm like, I fucking know what happened. Like, tell me who it is. And they, you know, didn't want to say it over the phone, which I get. And, uh, I, I had like one of those moments where I told him, no, I can't.

01:37:12.482 --> 01:37:41.406
I can't do that again. Like you have to get somebody who knows what the fuck they're doing. And he just didn't let me off the hook, you know? Get your shit and come into the command because you got to do all this prep stuff. And I walked into the conference room. I mean, I remember it clear as day. I walked into the conference room and I could see it on everybody's face. Again, this is 2010 now. They were more terrified than I was.

01:37:42.050 --> 01:38:11.678
these are civilian guys, guys who retired who are now civilians. They work at the command and amazing people. And they looked like, I don't know if you've seen Peter Jackson's remake, They Shall Not Grow Old. Oh, you have to watch it. They Shall Not Grow Old is Peter Jackson took real World War I footage. Oh, I did see that. Yeah. And he put the color and the lip reading. And there's a scene, I don't know if it's Battle of the Bulge or exactly, there's a scene where

01:38:12.194 --> 01:38:40.062
this young unit, army unit is about to go up over the top and run across an open field and the camera pans over and there's a young kid with his rifle in front of him, the bayonet affixed to it, his helmet on, his lips are sort of flat and pursed and he, everybody in that conference room looked like him. When I saw that movie later, I'm like, every single person looked like him.

01:38:40.514 --> 01:39:09.598
And they told me it was Adam and we were gonna go notify Kelly. His wife. And you had little ones at that point. Savannah and Nathan, yeah, they were small. And we knocked on, she had a sort of a stained glass window and I could see her at the top of the stairs. That was the worst, man.

01:39:10.786 --> 01:39:40.638
It was the worst. So we sat with Kelly and a bunch of other guys were there. Of course, it wasn't just me. And we did our best. And I learned later and reading Paul's work, Dr. Conti and other people and like that was it, dude. I was like a, I don't know if it's a locust or whatever that sheds their skin. I literally like left a shell of myself on Kelly's front porch.

01:39:41.090 --> 01:40:11.038
walked out of my skin. It was, that was tough. That was tough. And so that was kind of the tempo to answer your question. Like it wasn't exactly every 90 days, but almost every 90 days from 06 to 2011 for me, I got out in the fall of 2011. It was Memorial at the theater, Memorial at the people's house, you know, and our neighbor,

01:40:11.426 --> 01:40:38.622
across the street in Virginia Beach. She lost her husband in 07. So one house over. So she was best friends with us, you know? And so you are trying to live two lives. You have this military life with all these consequences where every bone in your body is telling you to go full Spartan. Like, no, not that the Spartans didn't have families because they did, whatever. But

01:40:38.850 --> 01:41:08.286
Nothing else, like just cut off every other thing in your life completely. You have to go do this and you have to do it full on because clearly all bets are off. Like we're barely making it through. We're losing our best guys. And how the fuck do I survive if at this pace? And so because we're all in the same community in Virginia Beach, you're around it all the time when you're home, you know, and you should be because you're supporting your teammates, families, and that's important.

01:41:08.578 --> 01:41:37.854
it was just it's almost like a dream you know when I think about it now how do how did we live like that how does anyone live like that and I know you know my experience as the military people go through you know all sorts of tough situations in different walks of life but I have so much compassion for anybody who's trying to live in an environment like that where you know you are going on the next deployment and you know I mean look Andrew we left Bakuba in 08 before Tommy was killed and

01:41:38.402 --> 01:42:07.390
Three fucking weeks later, guys are getting blown up in the same area. And they got all the debris from us. They knew exactly where to go, but it was just such a kinetic environment. It was almost like you couldn't stop it. It was just like the balls rolling. And when I think about people overseas and different situations that countries find themselves in right now, I can feel it for them.

01:42:07.682 --> 01:42:35.166
know what it takes. It's an intense environment. Yeah, certainly that comes through. I think years ago you said to me, and this will be an important way of setting aside which side people are on, whether or not you side with one group in the Middle East or the other, or you feel for everybody that

01:42:35.522 --> 01:43:03.326
One of the things that you said that really rung in my ears for a long time is that the warriors on both sides, in their own minds, each and all of them are just doing what they think is right for them and their families. Totally. You cannot erase that fact. Whether or not the government of this country or the government of that country or group was correct or incorrect, whether or not you're even talking about a terrorist cell versus a formal military group,

01:43:03.426 --> 01:43:30.206
special operations group, that in the minds of the warriors, they're doing what they truly believe is right for them and their families, and sometimes country as well. And when I heard that, it was sort of an obvious statement on the one hand, but it's a very important one, I think, to the psychology that everyone's fighting tooth and nail because they believe that they are right, or they're just fighting tooth and nail for whatever reason.

01:43:30.722 --> 01:44:00.606
And that was an important thing for me to hear. And I think about that a lot when I see any news stories about international conflict or terrorist military conflict, terrorist civilian stuff. Even people, there's something about the human brain. People get this into their mind, like this is my job and they're doing it. It doesn't justify it. But going back to this thing of being a weapon, humans can be trained as weapons and it's often not the weapons themselves that are making the decisions about where to go and what to do. Sometimes it is.

01:44:00.738 --> 01:44:28.350
At this time, Coleman, what's going on with the three boys, with Bridget? I mean, your boys have turned out really well. They're amazing. They're amazing. And there's no coincidence there. And obviously it was a team effort with you and Bridget. But there are a lot of things about the way the scenario you're describing here that speaks to like, how can a home function? But obviously,

01:44:29.634 --> 01:44:53.438
function well. And, you know, it's remarkable, but it can't be due to chance. So were you able to compartmentalize like the moment you hit your front door, your dad at home, your husband, your... And was that a pause in a conversation with yourself at the front door? That's just something that becomes reflexive. I mean, I...

01:44:57.474 --> 01:45:26.014
I think it was just reflexive. It wasn't really a pause at the front door. And admittedly, the story I would like to tell is that I was super zen about it and I had this process and I would come home and I would take this off and put on regular dad things. And I think I was just, by the same level of effort that we put into what we were doing, Bridget and every other wife, mom, mom,

01:45:27.874 --> 01:45:57.694
at least the ones that I knew, they put that level effort in as well. It made our home life just very comfortable. So it was easy. Like I didn't have to go through some process, right? It was, this is how I remember it. It was easy for me. I don't know if it was easy for Bridget. She would have to answer that question. It was easy for me. And so I felt like for the most part, like I was, I wasn't like platoon commander dad, you know,

01:45:57.794 --> 01:46:27.454
some movie, you know, the great Santini type dad, you know, I think Pat Conroy wrote the great Santini. Um, his dad was crazy apparently. I was like, that's what he writes about. It wasn't like that. It was more of this, this home is such a relief and Bridget is so dialed that I don't have to, unfortunately hard for Bridget. I don't have to do anything, you know, the time that I'm here, I can be here and then, you know, go away again.

01:46:27.618 --> 01:46:56.702
And so it's, as we know what trauma does to the mind, like there are many, many stretches of that time period that I just don't remember. And what I do remember is mostly, obviously the fun times, the front yard, the whatever, playing with the boys, doing rough housing and going on vacation and stuff. But when I was in the grind, when we were in the training cycle of our cycle or deployment or whatever,

01:46:56.962 --> 01:47:26.046
don't really remember sections of it. So a lot, far too many, I guess even one would be far too many doorbells, ringing on doorbells. You decide to get out. Was that a conscious decision based on time, conscious decision based on like, I would like to have the rest of my life. You're done. I like to call it a regret, you know,

01:47:26.562 --> 01:47:55.806
But it's just kind of emblematic of where I was. It was the right decision. I do not regret getting out at the 13-year mark, not for a second. I needed it. We needed it as a family. It was a snap. It was a snap decision. It was like a, what do we say, 24-hour decision. 24-hour horizon. I was standing on the ledge of the 24-hour horizon. And you said, what year was that again? That was the fall of 2011.

01:47:56.162 --> 01:48:24.414
Yeah. Okay. So that's about four or five years before you and I met. Yeah. Yeah. So extortion, we can just, we don't have to touch into it too deeply because people can look it up, but this was a massive loss of special operations, included a lot of SEALs. It was basically a helicopter shot out of the sky with a, with a, with a grenade, right? Yeah. RPG. RPG. People can look it up if they want to. And there's a lot of material out there about it. And it's just,

01:48:24.546 --> 01:48:54.334
can only be described as a tragedy. So, and I'm not trying to make light of it. I just think that we could do, there's a lot to explore there for in a different discussion. In case you're out, now the probability that you're gonna die is much lower provided- It's not what my nervous system said. Right. But you're out. And what do you do? Meaning, what do you do with all that energy? The energy of,

01:48:55.042 --> 01:49:23.486
the way you've been operating up until now, these intense battle rhythms, vampire schedules as you call them, but also what do you do with all the energy of what happened? I think this is where I think our conversation really hopefully has been related to other people as we've been going, but that sometimes I stop and I'm like, I know I'm supposed to process all this stuff that's happened, but it's like,

01:49:23.778 --> 01:49:53.438
do you do when so much has happened or when something's happened that you know you have to move on from you know you need to compartmentalize but that lives in our nervous system so are you thinking about that no you're Coleman Ruiz at that point you're just uh you're just going forward it's just fucking crazy I mean I just didn't know you know it's 2011 doesn't sound like that long ago but still in 2011 this was not a topic for conversation you know and

01:49:55.330 --> 01:50:23.806
I took maybe one week to process out. I turned in my gear. I turned in my badge. And my next visit to the command years later, I had to be escorted on by people I worked with in the same fucking squadron. Like, so within a matter of one week, I'm a stranger. Like, I can't get on the base. There's reasons for that. I get that. But I'm just using it as a... To make the point. There was nothing dishonorable about how you went. No, no, no. It's just that there's security reasons. No, once you're out, like, you can't just drive on the base anymore, you know? And...

01:50:25.314 --> 01:50:55.038
This is like emblematic of, of course I didn't talk to anybody about it, not even Bridget, but at the time in those first call it couple of years or even couple of months, I don't know. The question you just asked me is the question I was asked like, what do I do? Like not with work, like what do I do period with life? Like how do I manage my time? And I'm not some bumbling idiot. It's not like I was walking around the neighborhood, like trying to figure out where my house was.

01:50:56.354 --> 01:51:22.270
I had just been in that environment for so long, to your point, that I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what to do with my thoughts, my feelings, my, you know, I could go to the Buddhist five aggregates, my thoughts, feelings, perceptions, physical form, like all these things I've learned about and thought about later that have helped so much. I didn't know what to do with any of it. Like, I didn't know what to do with night sweats. I didn't know what to do with, I thought,

01:51:22.434 --> 01:51:51.038
term PTSD was the was the biggest fucking joke on the planet until I read all the symptoms and I'm like wait wait a minute um sounds like it sounds familiar and so it's that Andrew was like and so I remember like even the little things that kind of make the point of the big things I didn't know how to get a dentist I could just go to the dentist in the military I you know I thought when I was walking around the food line that somebody was going to call me and say come back to the base because

01:51:51.202 --> 01:52:15.070
like the bubble went up. You just, I had zero context and didn't have the, or not even just the courage, but know who to ask, right? It wasn't the mentoring. One of the most important books in my life in the last 12 years has been Joseph Campbell's The Hero With A Thousand Faces for the back end of the hero's journey. And- I haven't read it. I know I should.

01:52:15.202 --> 01:52:41.758
I know I should. You should actually listen to it. I should listen to it. It's better to listen. I've probably only listened to five audio books in my life. I prefer to read in paper because I can take notes in the margin. That book is better listened to. Hero with a thousand faces. The hero with a thousand faces. Could you just highlight a couple of the things that you took from the back end of that, that somehow shifted your mind toward like, like cue to you. I'm thinking Coleman Ruiz circa 2011 is like,

01:52:42.306 --> 01:53:08.798
like, what do I do now? And then something cues you. There's like a beacon someplace. It's like, I always think of this like a texture or something. And you're like, oh, I want to, you know, you want to feel it more to get a sense of what it is. Is that about right? It was in that case for sure. So Joseph Campbell wrote that book in 1949. And The Hero of a Thousand Faces is effectively the 17 stage hero journey, which by the way, George Lucas says and has said many times publicly, he

01:53:09.026 --> 01:53:36.318
built the arc of Star Wars around the 17 stage hero's journey. He credits Joseph Campbell's book for helping him. And if you ever read it or you go through the 17 stages or you see it or watch a short video, anybody, you'll see how damn near everybody's life, which is why it's called the monomyth. He describes it as the monomyth or the cosmogonic cycle. There's a little weirder term for it. But what he lays out in the book is, I don't know, maybe

01:53:36.770 --> 01:54:03.422
supposedly 2,000 years of culture across multiple cultures. The book is incredibly complicated in that sense. So I listened to it audio first and then went back to it and listened to it in paper. I could not believe how a human could put this narrative together, honestly. But the summary, I struggled with the first 10 stages a little bit, but I'll try to come back to them. If you look at the image

01:54:03.810 --> 01:54:33.182
when you lay out the 17 stages, the way it's in a circle is the ordinary world and the extraordinary world is on the bottom of the page. And there's a horizontal line, the diameter of that circle goes horizontally across and the extraordinary world's on the bottom, the ordinary world's on the top. Okay, and so let me talk about the back end of the journey first, because what I was mostly concerned about with when a friend pointed me to that book was my return to the ordinary world. And he told me, Coleman, you gotta read this book. And so the back end of the hero's journey

01:54:33.890 --> 01:55:03.774
the return section is seven stages of the 17. It's the ultimate boon, which is you learned something big in life. It depended on everybody learned something where you sort of realize that something big happened to me. That's the ultimate boon. And you have this incredible desire to do something with it. It's either knowledge or it's experience or whatever. And the ultimate boon you have and you feel

01:55:04.322 --> 01:55:31.518
this life thing and then the next stage is typically uh refusal of the return you really don't want to come back to the ordinary world because you feel that there is some level of consequence that maybe you can't handle or somebody won't understand you know or maybe it's too mundane you'll be maybe you'll feel uh adrift totally yeah that and this is in the description of the stages what you just described as part of that description

01:55:33.090 --> 01:56:01.214
next stage you're coming up back into the ordinary world on this return is magic flight and the way it's described in you know myths or in real life is you have to escape that extraordinary world and take one more dangerous flight or or sneak away or something is catapulting you to take that ultimate boon and fight against that refusal you're taking magic flight amazing

01:56:01.954 --> 01:56:30.974
And then there is, is it, it's assistance, I think. Yeah, it's like assistance from a, like a special power or something, which could be your own or somebody else. Right? And then suddenly you're into the last three, which is crossing the return threshold into the ordinary world. Master of two worlds where you finally...

01:56:31.522 --> 01:57:01.310
realize through help and or process where you can hold these two opposing life experiences in place and then the very last stage 17 is freedom to live and when you can I'm going to give you my little pet theory in a second when you can work your way through those stages you can have the freedom to live what I realized potentially happened to me just my internal feelings about you know my coming in

01:57:01.442 --> 01:57:30.142
out of the military and back, is if you skip or you don't figure out how to deal with the refusal to return and you just pick, I'm gonna call it the next big thing, you catapult yourself into a new cycle and you never finish. And one of two things has happened. You're either two people trapped in the ordinary world or you're one person trapped in two worlds. I don't know which it is. Like it's either two worlds and one person

01:57:30.274 --> 01:57:59.422
where it's two people trying to live in one world, but shit gets crazy, right? Because you just haven't done the cycle. And it sounds very mystical, but if you read it here with a thousand faces, you're like, this journey is not new. Like this is thousands of years of very typical human cycle. Now, if we go back to the top of the circle, let me try to scream through the first 10, which will be very obvious for Star Wars fans. Just think about what Luke does. And I'm not like a super Star Wars person. I've seen the movies, but...

01:57:59.650 --> 01:58:28.414
It's a call to adventure. Most of us have a call to adventure of some sort in our life. Refuse the call. Help from a mentor. Crossing the first threshold. The belly of the whale, which is described as when you first truly separate. This was me leaving for college. When you first truly separate from the ordinary world. Road of trials. Meeting the goddess. Temptations.

01:58:28.706 --> 01:58:58.622
Atonement with the Father, apostasis, which is kind of like dying a death while you're still alive. And then you're into those return stages. And when I first read that book, Andrew, I was like, I'm trapped in the return. I'm trapped somewhere in the return, just emotionally. And one of the places that I was absolutely trapped in the return was I didn't have the mentor to help me cross the threshold of

01:58:58.946 --> 01:59:28.318
I knew I had to move on in my life. I knew I had learned something extremely valuable. I knew that there was a way through, because people across thousands of years of humanity have done it. I don't think I'm special. And I never had the mentor. I got mentors later, you know, a couple of years out. And it reminds me that in the, so I got out in the fall of 2011, in the summer, one of my very good friends,

01:59:28.418 --> 01:59:55.390
who lives in Connecticut, he works in New York. He brought me to a lunch at some fancy club in New York with a guy named Buddy Buka, Paul Buddy Buka, who won the Congressional Medal of Honor. He was a West Point grad, he won the CMH in Vietnam. I'd been around a lot of famous military people. Lunch was very normal, Buddy was amazing. It was a normal lunch, we didn't talk about much impact. We didn't talk about combat action or whatever.

01:59:56.962 --> 02:00:25.438
was a green velvet set of stairs we were leaving the club the upstairs we were coming down the green set of stairs if I remember but he's a little bit shorter than I am he reached out his left I was on his left he reached out his left arm I was a stair one stair below him he stopped me I turned to my right to look at him he looked at me he said son you have it you know that you have it PTS and you're gonna have to deal with it and we left I got in a cab and I left and I remember thinking I

02:00:27.010 --> 02:00:55.806
you might have it, but I don't. Because that's the old days. Like we were prepared for this shit. I was still convinced that I'm good. Like nothing happened to me. Nothing in the military happened to me. That's just normal stuff. And all of our training, it's a story I told myself, all of our training prepared me for that. Like this, the rest of my life is just gonna, nothing bad's gonna happen because I'm good, whatever that meant.

02:00:56.322 --> 02:01:25.950
And when I started to learn more and read more and talk to people who were helping me, I remembered Buddy telling me that. And back to those return stages, Andrew, it's just incredibly important for me to understand that my journey is not special. We are part of a long history of evolution that people who go through very challenging. And I mean, the 17 stages in Joseph could not be more accurate to my life, particularly the return.

02:01:28.354 --> 02:01:58.142
And of course, if one looked from the outside, they would agree with your mindset then and say, you're alive. You certainly done very hard things, extraordinary things. You're married, you got three kids, they're thriving. PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, and things like it. Because I don't think any single acronym or diagnosis can capture anything. I think Paul Conti made that very clear to us in the mental health series. These are names by necessity.

02:01:58.306 --> 02:02:27.390
It's a framework. It certainly taught me something. Absolutely. And certainly those who haven't been in the military maybe had a seed event of something challenging or whatever it is. Many people struggle with these kinds of things that live inside them in their nervous system. They pack it down. Maybe they don't. But that was inside you at that point. I think you and I first got acquainted in somewhere around 2016. Mm-hmm.

02:02:27.650 --> 02:02:56.414
when you and some other folks from tier one community and related communities started coming to lab and my lab, and I never really talked publicly about my lab has been involved with various things in Canada and the U S I'm not trying to create any mystique there, but it's, it's not, not a point of interest what we did. And, and, but I recall at that time just thinking like, this guy's just an amazing team guy, but in any event, you know,

02:02:56.770 --> 02:03:23.582
We got to know each other a bit and my sense then was like, it's kind of indestructible, right? And now I realize nobody's indestructible. We're flesh and bone. But if we may, let's fast forward a bit to a couple years later. If you're willing to talk about it, maybe talk about some of the

02:03:24.578 --> 02:03:46.718
evolution that happened. So you started working a job, you're getting back into civilian life. And I recall a conversation about this time of year, probably about three years ago. Yeah. And you had done what a lot of vets from, you know,

02:03:46.882 --> 02:04:14.174
have done and are now doing, which I actually have mostly favorable outlook on, which is there, now these are, I wanna be very clear, legal and sanctioned explorations of the psychedelic space, right? And I remember you called me and you described the experience that you had had and some of the connection with warrior culture that that had,

02:04:14.658 --> 02:04:40.862
emerge for you. So could you explain what happened there? You know, probably the entry, Andrew, is as important, you know, meaning it's not all about books, but this is actually another thing I've really learned. You know, I was very intellect and achievement central. And as you can see how easy the emotion comes out now, I kind of very frighteningly understand people who like feel stuff a lot more

02:04:41.666 --> 02:05:08.318
whole other landscape. It's miserable. Well, wait, yeah, it is. And yet it's, I agree. It's a very uncomfortable space, you know, but we'll get there. It's a journey for me. I put it that way. So, you know, there's a bunch of other, I'm a voracious reader. I really enjoy it. And, you know, my entree and little window into the world of getting that kind of help is,

02:05:08.866 --> 02:05:38.462
from a lot of different areas. I found in our area a craniosacral therapist who it still seems like because I mentioned it to people and it sounds fringe to them. It's a very light touch, not even chiropractic like and it's closer to myofascial type of massage. Some tapping. Yep. Very light tapping on the top of the head. The part I actually love the most is the back of the neck sort of manipulation. You're lying down relaxed. Yeah, you're clothed. Super easy in terms of that. Yeah.

02:05:39.234 --> 02:06:09.214
I've been a couple years of that just because of athletics. I love massage and that's kind of my entree. So through the body, somatics. Yeah. Which frankly in many ways is my favorite back to the physical orientation to the world is what's useful to me. But also, I mean, I read Sam Harris' first book, End of Faith, in 2006. And so I've followed him for 15 years religiously, read all of his books, read all of his books.

02:06:09.730 --> 02:06:34.846
lying moral landscape and his I don't know him personally so public stuff notwithstanding that's not important to me but waking up and I took I took an online course with Robert Wright who who wrote why Buddhism is true but that's really not what he's known for you know Princeton professor he's so funny he's very humorous and I started to work my way

02:06:36.450 --> 02:07:05.342
I don't want people to think I have some whiz-bang, like spiritual practice that's whatever. But it became very interesting to me, Andrew. I started to realize I needed to find a way to back away from the 24-hour ledge. Like that super hyper focus. I needed to get a little bit of perspective. One of my favorite short videos is Richard Feynman's Pale Blue Dot. I needed to just back away.

02:07:05.602 --> 02:07:34.270
Reminds me, thank you so much for talking about time-space bridging, I think, the other day. Yeah, and we make, I'll cue people to that clip in the caption. It's a way of taking oneself out of one's immediate sphere of vision and looking, literally looking further out into one's environment and then back again as a perceptual exercise of understanding that as our visual field expands, our perception of time also expands. The binning, the chunking of time.

02:07:34.882 --> 02:08:04.734
and my and your conversation years ago about horizon and activating the parasympathetic system instead of sympathetic, I just very slowly started to realize I needed to back away from the small picture and the reading and the craniosacrum and the massage and I was still not really getting consistent real help, but I thought I could do it through educating myself intellectually. And I thought it was time

02:08:04.834 --> 02:08:33.630
and it was, it has short-term consequences, but long-term, it's been amazing to, you know, deal with the plant medicines in a controlled and curated environment. And that experience was super safe and quite amazing, actually. The weekend or the three or four days was super intense, but I didn't leave there thinking, again, I kind of thought I'm good. That was great.

02:08:34.850 --> 02:09:04.446
Yeah, a couple of things. One, we've covered psychedelics on this podcast before. I say this not for liability reasons, but just to really to emphasize for people's safety to protect them. Plant medicines are illegal most places still. This is changing. MDMA has been filed with the FDA as a potential treatment. It's not yet legal. These things have great power to heal in the right circumstances, and they also have great

02:09:04.578 --> 02:09:32.990
potential to harm in the wrong hands or circumstances, people with potential for psychosis, et cetera. But with that said, I remember I was on, I was driving, I was on a phone call with you around this time of year, three years ago, maybe it was four, but I think it was three years ago. And I said, what was your experience with Ibogaine DMT like?

02:09:33.858 --> 02:09:57.054
you said, it was among the most profound experiences of my entire life. And I recall you saying that you felt that it had connected you through time to all the warrior cultures that had preceded you, not just US military, but all warrior cultures. And you sounded great. You sounded like

02:09:58.626 --> 02:10:23.966
You weren't high, but you just sounded like, man, like something had synced up. And I thought, this is great. And I hadn't explored plant medicines, at least not in a long time, because I had done them recreationally as a youth, which I do not recommend. It took me down a bad path. And more recently I've explored them in controlled conditions. But I thought, awesome.

02:10:24.194 --> 02:10:51.838
You got this new job, you did some very controlled, and again, physician assisted, Abigain DMT experiences, and you're telling me how great everything was. And then about, I think it was about three, four months later, I got a very different call. And if you're willing, I remember that call.

02:10:52.034 --> 02:11:20.158
You can tell me about that. Yeah, so, I mean, the experience, it was incredibly powerful. You know, humor is such a powerful way to get through hard times is why I'm laughing. Yeah. But it really was, Andrew. I mean, to be fair to thousands of years of, you know, people having experience with these things, we often joked about, like, what poor sucker reached down and grabbed that root for the first time and chewed on it.

02:11:20.802 --> 02:11:50.238
boy, he found out. Or she. Or she, yeah. To be fair. To be fair, probably, you know, some session that wasn't supposed to go that direction and someone chewed on the wrong route. But, um, it was extremely powerful. Um, I've heard that, you know, the 5-MEO for some people is not much. It's like black. For me, it was just liftoff. And, um...

02:11:51.394 --> 02:12:20.766
saw an entirely perfect geometric mosaic in light blue and white and that was the warrior culture connection like that whole 20 minute ride was just something else um as you know i haven't done it noetic is the word noetic yeah that people use it's very difficult i don't have the language for it and a couple months later the bottom dropped out yeah and it

02:12:21.346 --> 02:12:49.150
I want to talk about that now. I also want to emphasize I know a good number of people that have had the same experience you did with Abigail DMT through the Veterans Solutions Group. And I know Marcus and Amber Capone very well. Actually, a bill just got passed in Congress that Dan Crenshaw helped spearhead to bring funding to use of psychedelics for PTSD treatment in military.

02:12:49.346 --> 02:13:19.102
And I should mention, because this was interesting to learn, that that bill was highly bipartisan. I'm not going to name off the names, because if I do, there's going to be a lot of cringing, screaming, and yelling. But it's like if ever there was a bill that was supported from both sides of the aisle with the most diametrically opposed names who came together around that funding, it's that bill. And just striking. And so this is a very bipartisan thing. So I will say a number of people...

02:13:19.330 --> 02:13:44.926
have been greatly benefited by the Veteran Solutions work. But, and we can't causally link what happened to you afterwards to that at all. There's a lot to it. There's a lot of contextual stuff. So we're not doing that, but we're an open book here. And I think that's a great group, by the way. Veteran Solutions is amazing. A few months later, you said the bottom dropped out.

02:13:45.058 --> 02:14:12.894
What happened and when did you start to notice it? And then maybe we can talk about that phone call. Yeah, I think, you know, looking back, Andrew, I think a couple things. Most people who call me about, you know, friends who say, hey, should I go do this? I initially tell them, well, 100% of the time, I tell them no until, until you get, I was having this conversation last week with a guy who I'd never met before.

02:14:14.082 --> 02:14:40.990
You need to stabilize your situation, whatever your situation is, through some very slow, deliberate Dr. Conti level help. Because in the case of, I'm happy to see that some people are using just a wider spectrum of on-ramp, not the nuclear option to start. I can tell you unequivocally, Abigain and 5M, MEO, DMT, two days apart is the nuclear option.

02:14:41.410 --> 02:15:10.718
It's not right for everybody. I'm not a scientist. There's no question. That cannot be right for everybody. That just doesn't make any sense. There's other ways to enter, I believe. And when you say the Conte option, well, just for those that didn't see the series with Dr. Paul Conte, we'll put a link to it in the show note captions. But what Coleman's referring to is talk therapy with somebody highly skilled. Yes. And perhaps also prescription medication if that's necessary. Maybe hormone therapy if that's necessary. That's up to the physician. But clearly...

02:15:11.170 --> 02:15:39.038
therapy with a skilled clinician? I believe I needed, I don't know what other people need, I needed a mentor to help me contextualize what I was coming from and what I'm going to. And my experience, you know, with the plant medicines was it kicked the door wide open and took that beautiful ice sculpture, perhaps at a person's wedding,

02:15:39.522 --> 02:16:08.094
shattered it on the floor. And I was, again, left alone. My fault, not anybody else's. Left alone to figure out how to put that ice sculpture back together, piece by piece. And my belief is I could have avoided that by having a much more deliberate process. So when suddenly the ice sculpture was on the ground, and every bit of intellect that I built over, you know, however long, four decades...

02:16:10.242 --> 02:16:38.111
I was flat on my back. And as I told you, Andrew, and I've been really verbal about with so many friends who only want to talk about it in quiet circles, which I totally understand and respect. And if you want to talk about it in a quiet circle, like email the Humor Life Podcast, and you can give them my cell phone number because I know how important it is to people when they're in that stage. That was...

02:16:38.530 --> 02:17:06.495
Another thing that I never thought was possible for humans, it was severe depression, severe. And I was so, because I guess I just never thought about it again, or never had a mentor. The shocking thing, Andrew, was how shocked I was. It was like, if I had known something like this was real, not that I would have listened to anybody if they said it, but the most shocking thing was that, again, this could happen to me.

02:17:07.170 --> 02:17:35.550
when it did happen, I was completely unequipped to deal with, I could, it took, forget how weak, forget every other thing in my life. It took 10,000 X the energy of anything I've ever done in my life before to just put my feet on the ground in the morning. I could not PT. I couldn't run. And you're like, I could not fucking function.

02:17:36.513 --> 02:18:04.350
did function somehow to some level but it was so terrifying I just have for anyone listening who has been I just have such incredible respect for people who have dealt with it and have learned to get through something like that depression oh yeah or any pick the pick the title right whatever tough situation someone's in emotionally I have such tremendous respect for them because I would have been

02:18:05.762 --> 02:18:31.103
years ago, the guy who like just tighten up your boots and get to it. It's not possible. Like you have to get help from people who care about you. And you have to like, you have to step back away from the problem set somehow and, and work through it, you know, step by step. One of the most helpful things, and I'm so feel so fortunate that I never really had like the chemical dependence thing. It was easy for me to stop drinking and

02:18:31.809 --> 02:19:00.191
When did you decide to stop drinking? It was around three years ago or so-ish. Prior to this lapse into depression? No, no, right during. Yeah, right during. You just figured alcohol is a bad thing right now. Yeah, and I mean, look, you and I have been friends for a while now, Andrew. Some of the things you and I have discussed and I hear you talk about publicly, they were just good reminders, you know? One of the things I absolutely hate, but I do every day, which is wait 90 minutes to drink coffee. Oh, it's the worst.

02:19:00.386 --> 02:19:26.270
cannot tell you how much of a difference that's made in my energy throughout the day and the drinking was similar you know i i like look i'm just going to drop it for a couple weeks and then suddenly my sleep's better my fitness is better you know so you know we all even my friend you know you chat about stuff oh what are you doing at this age you know i'm approaching 50 that helps you stop drinking everything else like all the other recommendations come second at least for me um

02:19:26.817 --> 02:19:55.262
was that pretty easy for you to do? Because I know there's a big culture of drinking in the teams. Yeah. I was just lucky. So my point there is, you know, just the respect I have for people who work through stuff like that. And I was going to say, the reason I referenced the drinking is because I started reading a lot about the 12 steps, AA. I've never been to an AA meeting, but the Simpson, the PTSD, and the 12 steps, I'm like, oh my God, this is me.

02:19:55.778 --> 02:20:24.382
I need to go through these steps in my own way, not for drinking, but for whatever this low grade, the way I've described it as, the Buddhists obviously call it dukkha, it's unsatisfactoriness. This low grade irritation that I carry around every day. The one amazing thing that that couple of months did for me, and the way I described it visually, is if someone cut me from neck to belly,

02:20:25.122 --> 02:20:51.614
filleted open my chest and took a propane torch and scorched me from the inside and then put me back together and said, start over. That's how it felt. That's literally how it felt. I mean, I could not believe, Andrew, and you can obviously, you know, Dr. Conti can articulate this better. I couldn't believe how emotional pain could be so physically painful. That whole

02:20:52.098 --> 02:21:21.694
Again, the shocking part was the shocking part. I just didn't think it was real. And so then when it was, and I'm like, how many fucking things do I have to deal with, you know? And I realized everybody deals with a lot of stuff. And it was challenging. And then slowly, you know, it got better and better. And guys like, you know, friends, very close friends,

02:21:22.786 --> 02:21:51.198
very, very small, tight group where... Man, what people do when you finally tell them and you think, oh, this guy's gonna... He's never gonna talk to me again. They do the opposite. They rally immediately for you, you know? And then guys that...

02:21:51.330 --> 02:22:21.278
aren't in your inner circle necessarily helping directly, and they're in the next circle. Because now, this is very weird, it's back to like the feeling thing. I can, not 100% of the time, but a lot of guys in my community, if I speak to them and they're in a bad spot, I can detect it within five seconds. Just the tonal and kind of like the tempo. And when you tell that ring of people, not your super inner circle, they dump it immediately.

02:22:21.826 --> 02:22:51.262
As soon as you open the door, they're like, hey, man, I had a couple of tough, like, months, you know? Boom! They're right in for the most part. They open up. Yep. And that really scares me, Andrew, because I know... Like, if we need to flip the switch this afternoon, like, we can flip the switch. Meaning? Meaning, like, I can go to old school 20, you know, 15 years ago. That's what you and I have discussed in the past is kind of come back to...

02:22:51.970 --> 02:23:21.054
the fighter mentality is the problem with that, the hardcore, intense, focused, that's easy. Like it's so easy to do that tough stuff. That's easy. This is the hard part. And that's what, you know, was so challenging. It was to go to people who normally we do, you know, the, yeah, yeah, let's do this, let's do that, let's do something crazy. Okay, well,

02:23:21.282 --> 02:23:50.942
that same person who you've built persona, identity, you know, around them and with them, they're like, you're this guy. And then you have a tough spot. Now you have to go tell them the opposite. Like, I'm really not doing well. It's terrifying. It is terrifying. And I, but I, I second with, with both arms, your statement that when we actually open up,

02:23:51.298 --> 02:24:19.870
to somebody trusted, hopefully a friend or somebody close to us, but like some people go to clergy or AA or any number of the different resources. And those resources really are out there at zero cost. They really are there if one has to look a little bit, sometimes a lot, unfortunately, but they're there. My experience has always been, and in observing others, that there's something about the human spirit that wants to help.

02:24:20.002 --> 02:24:49.374
And sometimes that help comes from somebody who's really been through it. But even if somebody hasn't been through it, there's something in our nervous system that sees real pain in somebody. And contrary to what we think, they don't judge and think that everything that the person who's hurting was before was a fraud. The contrary, they see it as an act of strength. But it feels like hell to reveal that. And I totally agree. I think all the tough stuff, all the...

02:24:49.730 --> 02:25:17.790
Anything physical is like a fraction of the emotional pain. And thank you for highlighting the physical aspect of emotional pain, especially if one isn't accustomed to it. If one isn't accustomed to it. If you're willing, you know, how bad did it get? I mean, the call we had suggested it was

02:25:18.018 --> 02:25:46.654
I sometimes refer to a line and I'd be lying if I didn't admit that I've seen that line a few times in my life. I've been right up next to it a few times. And now if I ever see it, I know to do many things when it first comes into my visual sphere. The line, of course, being the point which one is considering taking their own life. Something that happens far too often, even once is far too often. And we've sort of skirted around this topic

02:25:47.906 --> 02:26:15.358
after all the wartime stuff and the gunfights and people dying and the doorbells, been a lot of friends of yours and some of whom I know, but most of whom I don't, but- Two this year. Who continue to kill themselves, to put it bluntly. Where were you at with respect to that line? Because depression is one thing, there's mild depression, there's severe depression, there's recurring depression, there's manic depression, and on and on and on. But ultimately that's the thing that

02:26:18.018 --> 02:26:45.566
everyone's seeking to avoid. And it's a, yeah, how close were you? I would say there was probably, I really want to say one day. And the truth is, it was one day. It lasted one day. Being that close to the line. But it only takes a moment to go. That's the scary thing, right? And it probably lasted a couple of weeks, but there was only, back to the buds thing, like I never thought about quitting. I thought about it one day.

02:26:46.626 --> 02:27:14.462
What was the thought? It was, I mean, sort of like the classic symptoms, Andrew. I was up all night sweating and shaking and it's back to the shock of it. It was, okay, I actually was able to step, like one of two things is happening. Either I am fundamentally bad. There's no way you can feel this bad and be good.

02:27:15.362 --> 02:27:45.310
one of two things is happening. Like, I'm just bad, a bad person, which I know is not true, or something bad got inside of me that I have to get rid of, and I don't know how to get rid of it. And so, sweating, shaking, you know, up at three in the morning, and legitimately thinking, this is just the scariest thing for anybody in this situation. You think with every ounce of your being,

02:27:46.018 --> 02:28:15.678
people are better off without you. And then somehow, thankfully through chemistry, neurobiology, past learnings, I stepped back away from that very quickly. But the feeling of putting me up to that line didn't go away. I just intellectually was able to, it was kind of where the maladaptive behaviors, you know, back to training work in your favor, which is I'm not

02:28:16.034 --> 02:28:44.542
Like, this can't be just me, even though it did feel like just me. I mean, you suddenly become the core of the entire existence of the universe. You think like you're it, you know? But in the negative side of it, not the adaptive side of it. Because the pain is just so extreme. But I was able to back away from it. And then over... I'm so grateful to so many of my friends. I can't imagine...

02:28:44.930 --> 02:29:13.470
many hours if we collect up those hours, how much time I spent with them on the phone. And one of my, in the, like, in those really hard weeks, maybe a little bit after that injury, one of my buddies, I was actually just talking to him yesterday because I had time in the car. The tough love side of it, when you're feeling that poorly, is a little tricky. Like, I wouldn't, I probably wouldn't deliver tough love unless I really thought the person could handle it. I think it's

02:29:13.602 --> 02:29:41.086
got to really deal with kid gloves at that those moments but one of my buddies told me if you do something to hurt yourself you will have proven to every person who knows you that you are a fucking liar and a fraud everything you've been about your whole life is a fraud and Andrew I was we were on the phone I was like whoa my god he just went ten ring I mean dead center

02:29:42.338 --> 02:30:11.070
And that was a pivot. Like that really helped me a lot. So that's what you needed. I mean, I don't know that that's what I would have needed. I recall when we spoke, because I obviously not professionally trained in any of that. I just remember thinking, how do I put in this, this into language that Coleman's going to understand? And I just said, you know, I think your goggles are, I know one thing for sure, which is that your goggles are foggy. So you got to, so you have to outsource that.

02:30:12.034 --> 02:30:41.566
decisions now. I think you might have also told me to outsource my identity. And that helped a lot because it was that idea of you have foggy goggles, you're clearly like not on stable ground. Everything you believe about yourself, just let it be the spokes of a wheel that somebody else can hold for you for a period of time. I was like, well, I can do that. And then my other buddy, I didn't want to be a liar and a fraud. I was like, I can do that.

02:30:42.242 --> 02:31:10.078
Yeah. I mean, I'm grateful for the opportunity, but unfortunately I had a few circumstances where people close to me were at that edge and I'd be lying if I didn't say I've been at that edge. So I knew where, I had some sense of where you were at. And under those conditions, I don't think there's a playbook. I mean, obviously when people have a plan and they're thinking about implementing that plan, those people need to be pulled

02:31:10.594 --> 02:31:38.398
protection from themselves. Fortunately, it didn't come to that. Yeah. And you know, a few friends just did the basics, Andrew, which was, I really wanted to talk to you at that time, because I knew you would give me some advice. You know, I was so uncertain about just the, I'll just say the chemistry, but the chemistry in a nerve, like something is not right. Yeah. And you know, different friends offer different and some friends just sat and listened to it all. And when I think back, it's like,

02:31:40.994 --> 02:32:07.838
I would take a bullet for them because they just took it and let me offload it. It's an amazing experience for let people help you, which I was never willing to do. No, and you were, we have to highlight something that might have been overlooked earlier because we went through it quickly, but that you were a commander of a unit. So you're head of a family. I know Bridget's also head of family.

02:32:08.034 --> 02:32:37.022
to trade. You try. You go back and forth. Right, exactly. But you're used to leading and protecting others. And I think it's awesome that you're able to have access that raising your hand and asking for help. Yeah, I have to. It's such a sign of strength and skill. And it feels like the exact opposite in the moment. The exact opposite. The exact opposite. And then we go to these narratives like,

02:32:37.634 --> 02:33:06.142
well, if I've ever done that in the past, people didn't help. We come up with a million excuses, but in the end, it's such a thing of strength to do that. So you did ratchet yourself out of that very, very dark hole. Slowly. And I wanna place this in the context of this hero's journey. Would you see that, you talk about the magic flight that you're against,

02:33:06.402 --> 02:33:34.782
like the refusal, you won't go back. But so it was accepting, it seems that there was some pieces of you needed work. Yeah. That there was this PTSD, this gentleman that you mentioned. Yep. Saw that and you refused to kind of deal with it. And so shine a light on it and God, the universe, whatever your beliefs are, forced you to see it. Yep. And you went to the very bottom, but not out the bottom. Yep.

02:33:36.450 --> 02:34:05.086
What was the process of putting things back together? I mean, really, I mean, a lot of it, Andrew, was cutting out. So as a practical matter, I mean, I'm going to just go back to regular therapy because I don't... That... I mean, my therapist is amazing. So at what point did you enter a quote-unquote talk therapy? Immediately then. So you got a quote-unquote therapist. Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, effectively, you know...

02:34:05.986 --> 02:34:33.790
Bridget and I had multiple, at some point, Bridget was like, this is it, like full-time help, effective immediately. And I knew it was necessary, but if I'm really honest, I would have avoided it. I would have somehow tried to gut through the situation without full-time help. And I mean once a week therapy, yeah. So the idea of sitting down with somebody and talking about

02:34:34.114 --> 02:35:02.366
present and maybe some ideas of future was worse to you than jumping out of a planet at 3,000 feet or going into a gunfight? Not even close. Not even close. And... Hearing yourself say that, dude, you realize how... Ridiculous. Well, how untrue that must be at the physical level, but the nervous system doesn't know. To quote Dr. Paul Conti, the limbic system that...

02:35:03.106 --> 02:35:29.470
experiences or it creates this sense of fear and dread doesn't know the clock or the calendar. It's like if you go the meaning if you experience that there's the idea that it's going to go on forever. I think that's the fear. That's correct. Yep. That's exactly right. Thank you for saying that. The fear was this will go on forever. But so yes, I just did not want to

02:35:29.954 --> 02:35:56.158
back to Bessel van der Kolk's. When I read this word in his book, Body Keeps the Score, Lexithymia, if that's a real thing, where you can't put language to what's going on. I didn't wanna put language to it. I couldn't, I just didn't feel like it. Like I just felt like gutting through it. And then I got once a week therapy, amazing people.

02:35:57.922 --> 02:36:23.358
I don't know, Andrew, the first three months was, you know, I mean, gutting through, I just couldn't, I couldn't seem to shed that emotional, like, burden of pick the category of stuff from the last, let's just say 20 years. It was just, but it was all, I couldn't stop it from coming out. And obviously, that's a good thing. And so that just continued. And

02:36:23.618 --> 02:36:50.174
Every day got – and when I say – this is the tough part for at least me, and I know a lot of guys like me. The gains are minuscule, you know. But things improved slowly but surely. Were there ever moments where you felt you were drifting backward? Not really. That was nice, you know. You see that – there's some stall, you know, plateaus. You don't have to share this, but –

02:36:51.266 --> 02:37:20.958
I'm a believer that talk therapy can be very effective. Certainly that's been my experience. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for two in particular amazing people who really helped me along the way in that way. But I do think there's a place at times for pharmacology to assist the process. I know nowadays people hear SSRIs and they demonize those. That wasn't... I'll come clean. And then maybe if you feel like it, you can... I hit a bout of depression in my...

02:37:21.058 --> 02:37:46.750
my postdoc did a short run of Welbutin and Rupropion, which is more of the dopaminergic, noradrenergic agonism, mostly adrenaline noradrenergic. It really helped. It nuked my memory at the dosage they suggested, which meant I had to take a very low dose. And then eventually I came off. And I think that that's one thing I learned from Conti, which is that

02:37:46.882 --> 02:38:16.318
Most of these medications were designed to help people get over a bump as opposed to be taken continuously. Some people need to take them continuously. I have been able to be away from that for a long time, but I think pharmacology can help. Oh, yeah. I think I'd have to go back and look. Four months maybe of pretty low dose of Wellbutrin. Thanks to, yeah. Yeah, that's about right. Yeah, thanks to my buddy, Jimmy. I called him and asked him what he thought. And he said, well, you use a gun sight on your weapon, don't you?

02:38:16.546 --> 02:38:46.366
you use glasses if you can't see. Nah, I need reading glasses. You need glasses if you can't see, right? It's like, just fucking take to Orbutton, man. Chill. Like, just get it. Get some space. Back to the space-time bridging concept. Just get back away from the danger for a few months. That really helped. And that's very different than the backing away from the danger with, say, alcohol or drugs. And look, my stance on cannabis is some people can use it safely. Most people probably cannot, but some can. But the

02:38:46.466 --> 02:39:10.430
something different about the drugs that have an addiction potential or the drugs that disrupt sleep. Like ultimately, if you look at people who commit suicide, and I've spent a lot of time with this literature, in almost every case in the preceding weeks, there's a disruption in sleep schedules, meaning disrupted from what they were doing prior to that when they were not feeling suicidal.

02:39:10.818 --> 02:39:38.014
So then you think about alcohol disruption of sleep, even if you think you're sleeping. And like there's a story, like a common theme starts to emerge. So you stabilize sleep. You were getting some dopamine and noradrenergic assistance from the low-dose Wilbutrin. And you're basically also just letting it all out with a therapist. With a therapist. And the thing that strikes me as to your point about my resistance to therapy versus jumping out of airplanes or whatever is

02:39:39.362 --> 02:40:06.942
most important people in my whole life since day one have been people that have helped me coaches parents friends boom doug work colleagues the guys that i work for now like other you you have all these people helping you and then you hit this thing that's so unusual i'm like i don't want anybody to help me and i don't want to tell anybody about it it's like what is that andrew that was the it's like what is that

02:40:07.234 --> 02:40:30.558
And it's not like I wasn't in these environments where I've been coached and mentored. I've had coaches and mentors on my ass my whole fucking life. Like instructors, you know, it's a nonstop. And I don't know. I like I couldn't. I just couldn't do it until I did it. And then. And, you know, it's been a process since and I'm super grateful for it. And.

02:40:31.586 --> 02:41:01.278
I don't know where we are in the journey, but in terms of like the hero's journey, but I hope I'm at freedom to live some version of it because with my re, this is dangerous because I only say this like with my really, really, really close friends. I know this was going to more people in my, I feel like a completely different person. And none of that stuff really ever goes away. It's all a process, right? And I'm never going to stop the process, but I don't even recognize myself in some ways anymore.

02:41:01.890 --> 02:41:31.358
That's been a good thing because in those times when I was just on the 24 hour horizon sometimes, I just did not know what the fuck was going on other than exactly what I was doing, you know? And it's just an odd experience to be in a different place. And it's scary to know that without that experience and without people really kind of forcing me to get help and things forcing me,

02:41:32.002 --> 02:42:01.822
be doing the same stuff, which is a hard way to live, you know? Or worse. Or worse. You might not be here. Or worse, which has happened to many of our buddies, you know? And I want to go like retroactively hug them and collect them up in like a net and say, guys, just stop for a second. You know, like we, it doesn't, it doesn't have to go there. Yeah. I feel that the yearning in that statement is,

02:42:02.274 --> 02:42:30.590
I suffer from a terrible, very destructive, debilitating desire to travel back in time and fix things. It's like, I know I don't have, my graduate advisor who unfortunately all three of my graduate advisors are dead, but she used to say, my time machine's broken. Anytime I'd raise something, you know, that could have, woulda, shoulda, my time machine's broken. And we know that, but I,

02:42:31.010 --> 02:43:00.862
I felt that statement in every cell of my body. It's clear you would. But you're also, in sharing this experience and this information, you're doing that now in what we call in biology, in the intero grade fashion. And, you know, somebody, many people are gonna hear this and cue to the recognition of what's happened to them, hopefully before they get to that line. Yeah, you have to. And you just gotta tell somebody, you know, it's like,

02:43:01.314 --> 02:43:27.902
It's crazy how simple that is, Andrew. I mean, months. Like, I can't tell anybody. I can't tell anybody. And maybe we drill into this a little bit deeper, because I think that this really speaks to the global experience of being human, where unlike a physical wound, where if you see bone exposed, you're like, this is pretty serious. We all have different thresholds for what we can tolerate in terms of pain and seeing ourselves wounded.

02:43:28.002 --> 02:43:56.414
to decide what's the difference between hurting and injured. But when it comes to psychological stuff, we don't know. We also are dealing with a world now where some people feel psychologically injured by everything. So that's the extreme there. But I think what comes through, and I think people need to perhaps highlight in their minds is when something's kind of nagging or scratching at you beneath the surface, that voice, what do you think that voice is?

02:43:56.770 --> 02:44:22.846
I call it the low-grade pain. Okay, for me, it was – there was a low-grade, just slight hot burning starting in 07, probably before that, but it was – for me, it was a weird mix, Andrew, of like an uncertainty, a seeking, a –

02:44:24.386 --> 02:44:51.806
just doesn't feel right. Like it has to be fixed. There has to be an intellectual and achievement way to sort of get around. This is where the Buddhist writing and thinking really helped me a lot. There has to be a way around this low grade unsatisfactoriness somehow. My sense for me, and I'm obviously not, you know, the Dr. Conte in the room, but

02:44:53.634 --> 02:45:22.078
just because of all the things I've learned, it just had to be this constant, I'll use the word trauma, but for me, it was like something had to happen to our system. Obviously, it does. Something happens to our system that is a little bit of a boom, there's a shock there. Boom, and then a buddy gets killed, and then it's not even always with death, and you have extreme firefight or close call, and then it's just boom, boom, shock, shock, shock, shock. It's almost like getting...

02:45:22.338 --> 02:45:49.662
for the nervous system. It's just a constant high. To me, it always felt like that constant high end. Now, if you keep going, perhaps, if you never recognize any of it and you just keep jacking the dopamine and the adrenaline your whole life, maybe you can just never recognize it. But for me, when I shut the engine off and I decided it's not really how I wanted to live and I was trying to work out of that low-grade system

02:45:50.914 --> 02:46:19.902
I was residue that I was left with. It was like every time I came from home from deployment, I would get sick that night. Like I would have a fever that night, headache and fever. And I tend to get sick at the end of the year. Last two years, it was Christmas. This year was Thanksgiving. And, you know, Bridget and I always joke about it. It's because I slightly turn the engine down a little. And then, you know, the immune system. Yeah, that's the way it works. Everyone thinks stress is

02:46:20.546 --> 02:46:41.374
depletes the immune system and indeed it can. But if you think about it in evolutionary adaptive ways, go, go, go, go, go allows you to stave off the infection or at least to not have the symptoms of combating infection. And then when you relax a little bit, go on vacation, boom, you get sick. Which is not to say constantly stress, but you need to modulate.

02:46:41.602 --> 02:47:08.574
You got to modulate. But when you're on deployments, you don't have the option. No, you don't. You're in gunfights every day. Yeah. So as soon as you turn it off, you get sick. Right. But for me, in this particular instance, what do I think it is? I think it was all of those experiences at once, turning the generator all the way off or the electric panel fully off. And then it just all came out. Well, for people or anyone listening who...

02:47:09.122 --> 02:47:34.942
facing that feeling, that underlying feeling, or who is challenged with like a breakup, loss of a loved one, fear about the future, languishing because they don't know what the future holds, or the feeling that, quote unquote, so much has happened, or some combination of those five things.

02:47:37.410 --> 02:48:04.990
do you think the healing process starts? I hope, again, back to the hero's journey, I hope for every single person that it's not a rock bottom moment. But it seems like if you follow a lot of enough people and you hear enough stories, you've talked with Dax, right? Dax Shepard. Yeah. He talks about it nonstop. Like, unfortunately, I think a version of bottom is where the process starts.

02:48:06.946 --> 02:48:35.038
All the people I know, the stories they tell me, the process started when they hit some version of bottom. What's the quote that I love is, you don't change until the pain of staying the same is worse than the pain of change. Yeah, amen to that. I have experienced that more times than I would like to admit. And that brings me actually to this more macroscopic question. My understanding of the hero's journey from what

02:48:35.554 --> 02:49:03.102
I haven't read or listened to the book, is that we don't complete this cycle and then rest at the ordinary world where we are living in bliss and peace forever. We actually have to go around that wheel over and over and over again. Hopefully not going to bottoms that put our lives in danger, but it is not a process in which we ever really get to cruise.

02:49:04.322 --> 02:49:33.790
So let's orient Coleman Ruiz in that cycle. You seem to have returned to the ordinary world. For those listening and not watching, whenever you describe the feeling of getting through, but also that people assisted you, you smile. As friendly a guy as you are, I think in the first three years I knew you, I didn't see you smile once. That's probably true. I didn't see you smile once.

02:49:34.050 --> 02:50:03.294
I just thought, man, these tier one team guys, they're serious. They're locked in. They're locked in. But you smile a lot now. Yeah. So I think you're back in the ordinary world. What are the things you're watchful for? You're not drinking. You pay attention to your sleep. You always trained. You always did it. You call it PT, but physical training. Yeah, yeah. I trained pretty hard. Cycle, run. Swim. Lots of kettlebells. Yeah. Every morning.

02:50:03.842 --> 02:50:33.118
Uh, I train probably five out of seven days. And the two days that I don't train, I'm in, I have a sauna at my house. I'm in sauna at least for an hour. It's so funny how team guys talk about getting into cold or getting in the sauna. Like it's just a regular thing. Like they're, they don't, they never post it to social media for them. It's just, it's part of the routine. Yeah. But I say that because I think a lot of people think it's like this esoteric biohacking thing. Wrestlers and, and, uh, people in the military are custom to like sauna, cold, sauna, cold, just like,

02:50:33.474 --> 02:51:02.878
cardio lifting weights. It's not this esoteric thing. No, no, no. I mean, I think on average there's a sauna in Finland for like every single person in the country. So we didn't invent some amazing recovery process by doing sauna. Right. What do you think, what do you think it is about physical movement that helps the mind? Obviously it's not, it's, I consider it necessary, but not sufficient. Like you need to do the talk therapy, the working through, the writing, the reading, the introspection, the talking to other people, maybe pharmacology, but it's,

02:51:03.426 --> 02:51:31.294
does seem to be so important for resetting us. What do you think it is about physical movement? I mean, since it might go back to John Rady's little anecdote in Spark, you know, the sea squirt, I guess, swims around, and then as soon as it does whatever it needs to do, it just dies when it stops moving. Oh yeah, so the sea squirt is this aquatic animal, aplysia, as it were, that when it lands on a rock and stops moving, it actually digests its own nervous system. That movement,

02:51:31.394 --> 02:51:57.822
It's the great Nobel Prize winning scientist, Sherrington, that said that movement is the final common pathway, that movement is the way that the nervous system tells the brain and rest of nervous system that it's still needed here on earth. Which I like. It's like a... It reminds us of our own utility in a neural way. I mean, whatever that is, Andrew, right, the chemistry and the neurobiology of it all...

02:51:57.922 --> 02:52:27.838
goes back again going back to seventh grade I was at the end of the rope on the detentions and the suspension and I have this very clear memory that before my dad got home like I ran laps I don't know how many but a lot around the block and by the time he got home I was like whatever my punishment is I'm good like I'm not worried about it that physical activity for me all the time I don't want to overdo the runner's high thing but whatever that is that's what I think it is like when I'm in motion or my heart rates up

02:52:29.634 --> 02:52:58.942
most part, everything's fine. And I'm clear headed and I cannot be, again, dropping and drinking. I can't be lethargic and sit around. Like I have to, you know, take care of myself in that regard. I watch my sleep super close. If it gets past 1030, I'm in like a full blown panic. I need to get to a pillow. The basics, like I don't do anything crazy, really. You eat what you want.

02:52:59.234 --> 02:53:28.830
No, no. I would say on the neurotic scale of things, that's probably my most extreme. It's probably a little bit of cutting weight, kind of like eating disorder issues, if I was guessing. Not that extreme. So you eat meat, vegetables? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But I'm a really light eater. I eat like a bird and probably eight times a day, maybe more. Eight times a day? Oh, easily. I'll have, you know, thanks to you, I'll wait an hour and a half to have coffee, which is miserable. Okay.

02:53:28.962 --> 02:53:49.310
You're welcome. But it's amazing. Thank you. It's helped me so much. Well, you know, I take some shit for it because some people say, do I have to? Well, if I train first thing, then I'll have my coffee first thing. It was really to stave off the afternoon crash. But a lot of people find that experiencing that natural wake up. Mm-hmm.

02:53:49.474 --> 02:54:17.086
And look, it's 90 minutes. It's not like cutting out for two days or two weeks. Michael Pollan, I think, quit coffee. And I was like, why in the world would you do that? Yeah, why in the world? I love coffee, love yerba mate, always have from first sip. Which by the way, I had my first gourd of mate, caffeinated mate when I was four. There's a picture of me and my grandfather's lap. That's hilarious. Argentine side, yeah. But the point here is that these practices, these things, I think,

02:54:17.218 --> 02:54:46.718
They involve a little bit of discipline, but they really can have an outsized effect, I think. Oh, my goodness. Yeah, it's incredible. I mean, the eating thing and then maybe, you know, one more mental thing in this regard, I'll probably have maybe an avocado in the morning. And then two hours later, maybe one hour later, I'll have sliced cheese and an apple. And then... So you're a light grazer. Really light.

02:54:46.882 --> 02:55:13.214
probably have the smallest plate at dinner in my house. We've always been in great shape. Like visually, you're tall, you're lean, you're strong. Yeah. I think we're realizing now that you can still train on, you have to be like gorging oneself with calories. Yeah, especially now, right? Like we're both approaching 50. It's actually surprising how much I've discovered we can do on how few calories. And I'm not trying to like test it some crazy way, but then just eat throughout the day.

02:55:14.178 --> 02:55:43.966
And you know, macro life experience, Andrew, I just cut a bunch of extra bullshit out of my life. Big and little things like I don't, I try to just do my job and, you know, do a good job at it and hang out with my people, friends and family and all the extra shenanigans. Like I'll maybe do, you know, I was always doing some big race or some big mountaineering adventure, or I was just piling stuff into my schedule.

02:55:45.058 --> 02:56:13.534
might do one race in like in the spring. Everything else is casual, work really hard at it. I like cycling a lot. It's one of my favorites and go hard, but I'm not trying to race cat two or, you know, win some event or that release of extra bullshit in my life has been as big as anything else. And your boys presumably take some time and attention in here. They're great. Yeah. The, uh,

02:56:13.634 --> 02:56:43.486
Your son's a runner, university level runner. A lot of our conversation gets to some kind of core features of being human and the psychology of challenge and thinking one or others are invincible, discovering that none of us are invincible, but that we are renewable. You clearly illustrate that. There's clearly a message that

02:56:43.874 --> 02:57:13.374
Everyone is gleaning from this many messages, but what, if any, revision or adaptation do you think we need of the concept of being a man, growing oneself into a man? I'm not a gender studies sociologist, psychologist, neuroscientist, but setting all the sociology and the nomenclature aside, like...

02:57:13.986 --> 02:57:42.110
had a short list of things like seems like you believe that it's important to be able to do hard things but sometimes those hard things are not the hard things that you aren't we think they are like sitting down and telling one story being more terrifying than than going into gunfights overseas yeah yeah i mean it's funny that the prelude a little bit is i'm not a gender studies scientist either a sociologist i stay away from

02:57:42.242 --> 02:58:12.222
to these conversations, you know? But they're barbed wire. Yeah, they just, people seem to be so over-activated over stuff. It's very odd. But for me, in my life experience, Andrew, it's range. Like to use David Epstein's book title, right? It's range. And I've noticed this so much because of parenting and watching my boys grow into men. If I think about...

02:58:12.482 --> 02:58:42.238
come back to range. If I think about myself at 17 or 18, not my parents, not my coaches, unless I really wanted it, you could not fucking tell me what to do. You can't tell me what to do now. Like if I want it, I love the mentoring and the teammateship and the things that get you where you want to go. But if it's something I don't want to do, I'm not doing it, you know, no matter what. And so if I think about that in terms of being a dad or manhood is,

02:58:43.778 --> 02:59:13.182
take it back to my kids, like I think one of the most important parts of my job is to release the grip and take the reins off and just barely keep them inside the boundaries of alive. You know, because they're going to make all their own decisions anyway, and they have to. And so I think a big part that I see and I saw myself a lot for years was we overgrip sometimes

02:59:13.282 --> 02:59:42.910
Sometimes as men, like we are so afraid of losing control in an already uncontrollable world that we overgrip everything. And I overgripped everything. And suddenly when I'm not overgripping stuff, things are going better. And when it comes to range, it's okay. For me, it's okay to have your tough guy moments, your fighter mentality moments. I would never want to lose that because...

02:59:44.066 --> 03:00:13.726
matter how much help I get, when I'm out with my family or my wife or my boys, my head is on a fucking swivel. And if somebody touches them, it's curtains. And we need to keep that because that is just a part of life. Like you have to be, you cannot move through life with blinders on. Like there are people who are not good people and it's okay to have range and have that in your toolkit. What I don't think is okay to do is to let people

03:00:13.922 --> 03:00:42.686
that slice of the traditional, whatever you want to call it, aggressive manhood, be your whole life. Like that's just not functional. You know, it's not good for relationships, it's not good for parenthood. So every other little tool you can put in that toolbox that takes you all the way over here to what we might consider, oh, Coleman's gonna, he's soft now. No, no, don't mistake my kindness or weakness. There's a category for everything. And I think that makes you such a much more complete person.

03:00:43.362 --> 03:01:11.070
It's made me a more complete person. It's difficult. I feel like I'm brand new at being able to do other things in my toolbox. Like this part's easy. I can go jump to that in a nanosecond. This part over here of normalizing life across a whatever, 80, 90, it's really hard to sort of excavate the normal shit.

03:01:11.906 --> 03:01:37.150
that's what I think we need to do. You know, I mean, it's okay to be kind and calm and gentle. And, you know, that's, there's nothing wrong with that. And I'm guessing the word surrender probably held a far different meaning for you in the past. But a lot of what you're describing is surrendering to the realities of life that we can't control everything. And just how painful it is to, to,

03:01:37.570 --> 03:02:06.398
go that surrender and here I'm talking to myself too it's been it's a process I'm still deeply involved in you know somebody who's tried to you know go rung over rung as best I can doesn't Andrew speak to our like evolutions like that is so difficult at least for me and guys like me I'm putting you in my group here that is so hard to do like that just tells me more about the evolution of our male system like that part's so easy and this part is not so easy but man it's a

03:02:07.074 --> 03:02:36.094
the battle to remind myself, slow down, listen, just the basic shit. You don't have to go attack every problem like a fist fight. It's tough. It is tough. And I think that the more that I resist surrender, the more that, well, I believe in God, so I'll just say God, but God, the universe or whatever it is for people. But for me, the more that God places me in circumstances that make the act of surrendering harder,

03:02:36.610 --> 03:03:03.934
If I would just do it on my own, it wouldn't have to be so hard. I wouldn't have to, a good friend of mine, I'll mention my name, Tim Armstrong. He just said like, you gotta hit every branch on the way down. He was telling me I had to. He was like, you're a stubborn punk rocker, you have to. And he was talking about himself too. Like there's certain phenotypes where we have to, but the universe just screams out, you don't have to.

03:03:04.162 --> 03:03:32.062
can actually just like lower yourself down on a rope to the ground and walk away. But then there's that stubbornness. But I think that the stubbornness has its evolutionary adaptations too. And the hero's journey, nothing in the hero's journey says that the transitions between these different states are linear, are of equal duration, are of certainty, only that they exist and that there's no way, as you point out before, to skip steps. You can't skip. I couldn't skip.

03:03:32.706 --> 03:04:01.726
Nobody skips. Nobody skips. I mean, it's like you hit every branch. Nobody skips. And whether or not somebody tries to skip through psychedelics or through being the toughest or through the acquisition of money or just focusing on family. You know, family obviously is super important, but that's not going to accomplish the other aspects of the journey. It's a huge part of it, but it's not the only part. Again, necessary, not sufficient. Yeah, it's like, again, it's the 12 steps or some I'm not that experienced in, and I just read about it a decent amount.

03:04:02.018 --> 03:04:31.486
hitting every branch. You gotta follow the steps, man. Or you can live with that low-grade pain nonstop. It's not a good way to live. No. Because even if you're not conscious of it, it erodes you in ways that are very destructive. I wasn't conscious of it at all until the universe, as we say, came in with a fucking wrecking ball and said, fine, you're not gonna listen? Sent you all these messages, you're not gonna listen? Okay.

03:04:33.666 --> 03:05:01.342
it's important that we at least briefly touch on where things are at right now. Um, because it would be remiss for us to give the impression that like you're sitting there meditating, you're drinking your coffee 90 minutes late, late after you wake up, you're, uh, sitting there in bliss and thinking about all the great things that happened, how you made it through. Like there's still a lot happening right now. So, um, to the extent that you can share, um,

03:05:01.954 --> 03:05:29.918
working all the time. What are you doing nowadays as a vocation? I was in private equity for a while before I met you, running a company for a really good friend of mine named Tom Ripley, amazing guy. And then I stepped away because I was exhausted and I didn't know how to say it. I didn't know how to tell anybody. Like I needed to escape again, take magic flight somehow, you know? And he and I are incredibly close. Like he was one of the guys who

03:05:30.370 --> 03:05:58.078
that super tight inner circle. And then I came back to it with, you know, with this team that I'm on and serve as the chief operating officer at Lyd Sports Group, the largest brick and mortar licensed sports retailer in North America. We have 2,000 stores during the holiday. We have 8,200 employees and amazing team. The private equity firm that I work for is an amazing team and

03:05:58.690 --> 03:06:28.094
company is an amazing company and just incredible group of folks. Um, and so, yeah, I work a lot. I was out here doing store visits in San Francisco and LA and that's, it's all good. And I think, um, I do those little things all day long, all the time, but no, I am not sitting on a mountaintop. Like most days, there's no meditation at all. Andrew, it's meditation as a workout. Tom and I throw kettlebells around multiple times a week and, um,

03:06:28.194 --> 03:06:56.030
I do those other little things, but the difference for me is I'm okay with it. And I say that because I was incredibly busy, you know, before when I first got out of the Navy. And I wasn't okay with it because I thought, again, this is back to the hero's journey. I thought like the return to ordinary life was going to be sunshine and rainbows. Like, look, I have the ultimate boon.

03:06:56.962 --> 03:07:23.742
had this big experience, not that I wanted to be like front and center in the media, but here I am world. It's calm out here, right? Like we get to chill and have a good time and sleep and nothing is stressful in the real world, right? Wrong. I just wasn't ready for that. Like I really genuinely thought that it was just going to be easier. And so when we talk about the low grade pain injury and like the, you know, what is that?

03:07:24.098 --> 03:07:53.278
that was one of the biggest frictions like holy shit I did all this stuff all these deployments lost all these buddies and there's no fucking rest like the regular world it's not it's supposed to be easier at least that's the story that was in my mind going through all the stuff we just talked about now I'm okay with it like I like it I know how to manage my life I know how to manage my time for the most part I have a different relationship with

03:07:53.730 --> 03:08:22.270
teammates and my mentors and my bosses and my own work life. And I love it. Like, I feel like I'm back to in a very different way where I was when I was in the squadron back in 07. I feel like I'm on... I hope this doesn't get clipped, but for me, I'm on another level. Like, I really feel good about where I'm headed. And I haven't felt like that since I went into college, you know? I felt like...

03:08:22.370 --> 03:08:52.062
was just deteriorating and now it's not, which is nice. Well, the beauty of what you just said and everything you've shared today is that, I don't know if it occurs to you or not, but you've been providing mentorship to millions of people in the form of sharing your experience of your own hero's journey. And I wanna thank you for making it so,

03:08:53.154 --> 03:09:22.302
as to what your experience was and being unafraid or perhaps afraid and doing it and telling us anyway, exactly what that felt like. Even better in that sense, and stepping into that fear, but also making it so clear that while your life experience is extraordinary, SEAL teams, tier one teams, all of it, that,

03:09:23.298 --> 03:09:51.454
Everyone's life has these components of extraordinary and the opportunity for extraordinary and the return and renewal through the ordinary world. So much of what you shared has meaning regardless of people who are male, female, young, old. So thank you for being a mentor today and for having the bravery for stepping out into the quote unquote ordinary world, which is oh so.

03:09:51.874 --> 03:10:19.774
Unordinary. Unordinary. And if you're willing, I think it'd be great to have you back in maybe a couple of years and see where you're at. Meanwhile, you and I will be in touch often as we frequently are. Thanks, Andrew. Appreciate it. Coleman Ruiz, thanks for everything you've done. Thank you. Thanks for everything you're doing.
