I'm a severe gambling addict. Every single addiction is gambling addiction. If you drink and drive, you're gambling. Addiction is one of those things you can't apply logic to. People are like, what are you running from, Dave? I'm like, well, I'm running from myself, dude. I don't want to look in the mirror. I don't want to see myself. I hate myself. So I'm just running. So as long as I'm like doing graffiti, running from the police, you know, just hopping on a train, like literal running, like literally running to make sure I'm never...

00:29.058 --> 00:58.302
sit still for one second, like, what are you doing, Dave? I'm playing drums in a band. I'm, you know, at a casino, I'm traveling, doing the news for Vice. I'm painting at this, like, I can't, I can't sit still, because that means I have to sit with myself, and I can't do that. I can't do that. I couldn't do that. I couldn't do that. I can now. Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science,

00:58.434 --> 01:27.230
and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is David Cho. David Cho is an artist. He's a highly accomplished painter, graffiti and street artist, writer, podcaster, and television host. Many of you are perhaps familiar with David as the guy who famously painted the original Facebook offices, took equity for the job, and got rich.

01:27.362 --> 01:56.222
Now that's a wild story, but David's whole life journey, what he did prior to and after that, and what he has overcome along the way is a million times wilder. As he shares today, David grew up hearing and thinking that he was destined for greatness, but also hearing and thinking that he was a total disgrace. Today, he talks with complete openness and vulnerability about addiction, about cycles of success and failure, and about channeling and overcoming deep shame. Today's podcast is unlike any other that I've hosted.

01:56.386 --> 02:23.358
David is wide open about his childhood abuse, his massive success, then career setbacks, relapses, and transmuting every possible emotion into art along the way. So no matter who you are, David's story, and just as importantly, how he's living right now, how he shows up on this podcast, will change what you think is possible for you in life. It will force you to look inward and to use whatever joy and pain you have inside of you to be the best human being you can possibly be.

02:23.618 --> 02:50.366
David Cho is, as we say in science, an N of one, meaning there is no other like him. Yes, because of his incredible art, but also for his willingness to share so openly and honestly so that others can benefit and grow. I consider it a true honor and privilege to host David on this podcast. And frankly, it's impossible not to love him. This one is incredibly raw and honest. It's also full of surprises, many of which are fun surprises.

02:50.466 --> 03:17.310
So buckle up. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, today's episode does include sponsors. And now for my discussion with David Cho. David Cho, welcome. Thank you for having me, man. Man, huge longtime fan. Love your art.

03:17.506 --> 03:46.014
I've been super inspired by your YouTube channel. I watch it sometimes before I do my drawing or I prepare for a podcast. What are you drawing? I draw a lot of anatomy on top of some paintings. So I do neuroanatomy on top of some paintings that my friend Tim Armstrong has been doing. Musician at Leeds Center. Is it anatomically correct or is it like exaggerated or is it? This is a really good question. So in essence, it's anatomically correct. Yeah. But...

03:46.722 --> 04:15.774
Around the turn of the last century, two guys, Cajal and Golgi, won the Nobel Prize for drawing the nervous system and showing these things no one had seen before. And they stripped away everything except the essential piece. I'm going to come paint with you. I'm going to come paint with you. Yeah. I don't like what's happening in your painting studio. Okay. Just from what you said so far, it's not good. Okay. But it's good because you did that, and then now we have to strip that away. We have to get at the core of it because...

04:16.098 --> 04:45.214
Painting is... Wait, weren't you in the middle of complimenting me? Like, keep going. I mean, I love your YouTube channel. I watch it before I prepare podcasts and before I paint or draw. And I'm back to drawing a lot now. And I live... I converted an art gallery into a living space. And somehow I thought that that would make me more inspired. But it turns out it does. A lot of things do. But I think...

04:45.730 --> 05:12.446
The key with anatomy and trying to teach science with drawings is can't be too much detail, can't be too little detail, otherwise people are overwhelmed. It's the best thing for, I think, everyone, but for someone like you who spends a lot of time in your head, I always say the longest journey you'll ever take in your life is from your head to your heart. And to be an intellectual person, you just live a lot, a lot. You try to rationalize and apply logic to everything.

05:12.610 --> 05:42.334
Painting is not that, music is not that, creating is not that. It's just to get to this. And so for, but it sounds just in the little that you've explained that your painting is very methodical and which- Super meticulous. I wanna include every cell type. Yeah. What's your threshold for positive affirmations? Can I go now? Like you? I mean, I like to think I have a thick skin, but who knows? No, it's all love. Okay. For anyone who's watching or listening,

05:42.434 --> 06:06.238
This is my first time meeting Adam. Andrew. All good. There you go. Yeah, all good. All good. You knew my last name. You know what? I was thinking about my friend Adam. All good. That you know, that I used to skate with, I think. Adam Krohn. Yeah. Yeah. I was just thinking like. Upper Playground. Yeah, Upper Playground. Yeah, he worked. His dad owns Krohn's shoes in Palo Alto. He wants to reconnect with you.

06:06.370 --> 06:35.998
Man, Adam Cronin and I grew up together. Yeah, I was just... He had a mini ramp in his backyard. We hung out, we skateboarded, and then he started Upper Playground, the Walrus. That's it. He's your homie? I used to work for... I did tons of graphics for Upper Playground. Wow. Does anyone call you Andy? My skateboard friends call me Andy. So, yeah. But that's it? Like, no one in the medical, like, science world? Not anymore, no. Not really. That would have, like... You start your podcast and you do your... You're like, I'm Andrew Huberman. I'm a professor, yep.

06:36.354 --> 07:05.566
Like, I'm going to be all over the place because I'm nervous being here right now. I hardly do podcasts anymore. So I'm going to be all over the place. It's going to be sloppy. This is your canvas, man. Have fun. Well, I'm just meeting you. I already called you the wrong name, which is horrible. I hate the black. I hate it. The studio? You with the black T-shirt, the black mugs, the black, like, I don't like it for you, you know, because I used to,

07:05.762 --> 07:33.694
I used to only wear black because I was like, ah, I'm a painter, I'm always dirty. I don't wanna like, you know, you could see the ketchup stains on my sweater and it's like, okay, that's fine. But I just, colors are very important in not just painting, but like the palette for your house or, you know, like most people talk about in the modern age, modern man is,

07:33.954 --> 08:02.238
you know, and I just make shit up so you could correct. You're like the facts guy, but I feel like most people, human beings alive today are going to die a very, it's mean to say boring, but just the same death, right? You'll most likely die laying down in a bed or hospice or in a hospital bed. You know, it's just like, no one's dying. Like, I know there's other countries where there's war and famine, but I'm saying modern cities, you know, like there's not like a hero's death, right? So it's just,

08:02.434 --> 08:27.806
It's all the same and then you just, you know, the drive here in traffic, it's like everyone either has a black car or a white car or a gray car. And then you get to their house and their house is a beige or a white and you're just like, we only got one of these. You know, whatever your views on the afterlife are, but this is it. This is it. Like, this is it. And it's just like people get mad of like, oh, I spilled paint on the floor. Like I got a scratch. I'm like, paint everything.

08:28.386 --> 08:56.478
Paint your fucking car. My kids drew my sweater. It's my favorite. I like that sweater. So I walk in here and I go, fuck, dude. And I'm projecting on you now. When I wore all black, it said a lot about where I was at in my life. And I don't know where you're at because I'm just meeting you. But it's like everything is black on black. Like black on the black t-shirt, black mug, black. And it's like white t-shirt. For my dream, my...

08:57.218 --> 09:26.558
selfishly my dream is like this podcast would start instead of saying hey I'm Andrew Huberman like Stanford scientist that is just hi I'm Andy and then like you can you Photoshop like a white t-shirt on I'd wear a white t-shirt I don't know I don't like black for me I I have hardly ever black clothes anymore I want to add as much color because I I just uh maybe that's the season I am in my life or the the time I'm in but um

09:27.554 --> 09:56.830
Yeah, I appreciate you saying the nice stuff. I never thought I would be a YouTuber, but that's providing a lot of joy in my life. And so I want to say to you, I'm meeting you for the first time. I've never seen you clean shaven, but I imagine, I mean, your beard and facial hair to me look very cute. You're very handsome. Your voice, when I hear your voice, immediately is soothing. And I feel...

09:57.538 --> 10:25.150
Like this is a very kind person. Like once again, without having, like now I've met you for like five minutes. I'm like, oh, this guy's super awesome. But you know, like these kind of parasocial relationships where I could go even, I don't know how hard you want to go today, but like, it's like I meet people all the time and then I meet them and it's like, I've already met you. Like we've already talked. I don't know what your views on telepathy and spirituality. And it's like,

10:26.658 --> 10:54.846
It's just everyone will meet. Everything's going to happen the way it's going to happen, and everyone's going to meet who they need to meet. It's like all energy, right? You put this like, what? You know, I could sit there and go, why does Andrew Huberman want to meet me right now? And it's like, well, what am I putting out in the universe? And what is he putting out in the universe? And do the souls connect in that way, you know? So I said if I ever meet him, I just want to tell him how cute he is, how soothing and relaxing and like,

10:55.330 --> 11:24.062
There's something very, this is the invisible ingredient in like everything in art is did the person care, right? Like, I don't care how skilled and crafted, whatever, like did the person care? And like, when you do stuff in your voice, the tone, the frequency that's hitting my soul is like, oh, I don't know everything that guy's saying. He's using some big words, but I feel like he cares. And so I said, if I ever meet you,

11:24.706 --> 11:54.174
And I know a little bit from us talking on the phone, but I don't know your whole backstory, but I'm like, also I project a lot and I make a lot of assumptions, which that's a defect that I'm working on. But I just wanted to say, even though you had a horrific traumatic childhood, the fact that you're here, you're alive and that you're doing all this good stuff, it makes me emotional because I'm like, I don't even know you.

11:54.338 --> 12:22.654
and I appreciate what you're doing. And you're still a little bit immature, but progress, not perfection, right? So I think that's it for now. But I just wanted to tell you all that because I feel that way about you. And I, you know, I like, I'm a big, sometimes you feel stuff and you're like, I'll text it to them or maybe, you know, and I just go, no, if I feel that, I just want to,

12:23.074 --> 12:52.990
Especially if it's love and positivity. I know I started by telling you how much I hate your decor and your interior decorating, but it's because I like you. Like I wouldn't, if I did, if I like, if I'm like, I don't give a shit about this guy and I don't want a relationship with, I would never say anything. But I'm like, this, I don't know what the science behind it, but being surrounded by this much black cannot be good. Right? It can't like just, you were walking into a black hole right now. Like, I don't know. Anyways, that's, that's what I wanted to say.

12:53.570 --> 13:18.654
Man. Well, I'll take that in. Thank you. A lot there. Thank you. Were you able to take it in? Yeah, I was able to take in some of that. All right. It's interesting when you call me Andy, it's a different part of my persona, just because that names carry a lot. Oh, yeah. Thank you for that. I'm going to take that in. And I get this little voice in my head that's saying, I want to be very clear. I had some rough, rough,

13:18.818 --> 13:47.710
aspects of my childhood. I've made good amends with my parents, so we're good now. I say that to, you know, for all the reasons people can assume. But here's the thing, I knew somehow that we'd eventually crossed paths, I just didn't know when. So you say the telepathy thing. For me, I was a postdoc at Stanford, that comes after PHD, you do like five years, it's kind of like a residency. And I'm from the South Bay. And I didn't wanna go back to the South Bay because as you know,

13:47.842 --> 14:17.086
No disrespect to the South Bay, a lot of interesting things come out of there, but it was pretty devoid of the things that I like, which normally are in cities like art, live music. It used to be like that. Grateful Dead were in Palo Alto. I saw Fugazi play at the edge on California Avenue. There was a lot of interesting things about Palo Alto, but it became very right angles when the tech industry really exploded there. And in 2007, when I was a postdoc, was when you were muraling at Facebook. I learned that later. Yeah.

14:17.634 --> 14:41.886
But that was a time when I was back there for my science career and I was pretty miserable being close to home again. Honestly, I didn't want to ever go back there for a while. It was not healing. But when I learned your story about muraling at Facebook and some of that, I was like, oh, there was at least one other person here who was like in the kind of...

14:42.498 --> 15:09.534
spiritual emotional fight with what the South Bay is. And then I realized that I heard an interview with Ian McKay from Meyer Threat. It turns out he had been in Palo Alto because his dad was an academic or something like that. Of course. And he had skated some of the same ditches we had. And so there's a history of people being really frustrated with being there. Really good Vietnamese food. Is there really? Yeah. Oh, in Palo Alto or the South Bay. Yeah. Oh yeah. Castro Street Mountain View. Yeah. And it's changed a lot. But

15:10.722 --> 15:40.286
Take me back to 2007. I don't know how you feel about historical stuff. Okay, so we're definitely, I'm definitely down to time travel and time jump and all that. But because my, I'm older, I'm 49 and my attention span is just completely fried. I'm gonna, I'll just say right now, I'm gonna get a lot of dates wrong. Like I'm not like, you know, things, people are like, that's, you know, like. 2007 was when the Facebook offices were what kids from the South Bay called the neck of University Avenue, right? Before it goes under,

15:40.386 --> 16:06.046
the train tracks, as soon as you're on the other side of the train tracks, Caltrain, it becomes Palm Drive and it's up to Stanford. And so that was offices now are Palantir, which catches a lot of heat for other reasons. But those offices, right as you go under the train tracks, for us, there was a curb cut right there and there was a board slide thing. And so for the skateboarders, it was one thing, but then that was Facebook offices. And years later I heard

16:07.330 --> 16:32.894
David Cho was merely at Facebook. So how did that come to be? I'm going to be like very sloppy, like I said, and it's maybe some of the stuff because sometimes it's the way I treat talking and journalism and podcasts is like, it's like a story in my own head. Someone else is like, just shut the fuck up and answer the question. Right. But like for me, when I paint, I don't sketch. I go straight to finish. And I, so sometimes I'm,

16:33.378 --> 17:02.878
figuring out what I'm trying to tell you. Because you asked me a question that's very direct, but the way it went into my head was very abstract. So if you let me do a little paint mixing, I hope I'll answer your question. But do you know Pee-wee? I'm wearing it today. Do you know Pee-wee's Playhouse? I knew, oh yeah. I met him actually once. Paul Rubens? Yeah, at a photo show of Mike Muller and Sage, who draws Pee-wee's Playhouse.

17:03.010 --> 17:32.990
butterflies on Mike Muller's sharks and animals. And Pee Wee Herman, in his thing, in his suit, the whole thing, walked up. Laird Hamilton was there. Nice. And he walks up to Laird Hamilton. There were a bunch of people around. Everyone's trying to get to Laird. Laird's like a... This was 2017. And I was in West Hollywood. And Pee Wee Herman walks up and he goes, I have to meet you. And Laird's like... And the best thing is Laird just goes, oh, hello. What's your name? Like typical Laird. Like Laird's a real gentleman always, you know? And he's like,

17:33.122 --> 18:00.606
And, uh, I couldn't tell if he knew or not. And he's like, I've probably wanted to meet you this kind of thing. And, uh, and I was like, no way. And he had the whole thing, like the, the shiny lips and the thing. And I was like, that's Pee Wee Herman. That's amazing. I love that. Yeah. All right. Well, I mean, I'm definitely gonna have to tell you my Pee Wee Herman story at some point. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor, Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.

18:00.770 --> 18:25.406
One of the best ways to ensure you get a great night's sleep is to make sure that the temperature of your sleeping environment is correct. And that's because in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees. And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, your body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees. Eight Sleep automatically regulates the temperature of your bed throughout the night according to your unique needs.

18:25.506 --> 18:53.694
I've been sleeping on an eight-sleep mattress cover for nearly five years now, and it has completely transformed and improved the quality of my sleep. The latest eight-sleep model is the Pod 5. This is what I'm now sleeping on, and I absolutely love it. It has so many incredible features. For instance, the Pod 5 has a feature called Autopilot, which is an AI engine that learns your sleep patterns and then adjusts the temperature of your sleeping environment across different sleep stages. It'll even elevate your head if you're snoring, and it makes other shifts to optimize your sleep.

18:53.890 --> 19:19.966
If you would like to try Eight Sleep, go to eightsleep.com slash Huberman to get $450 off the Pod 5 Ultra. This is part of Eight Sleep's extended holiday sale, which goes from now until December 31st, 2025. Eight Sleep ships to many countries worldwide, including Mexico and the UAE.

19:20.386 --> 19:32.958
Today's episode is also brought to us by Element. Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't. That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium, all in the correct ratios, but no sugar.

19:33.090 --> 20:03.056
Proper hydration is critical for brain and body function. Even a slight degree of dehydration can diminish your cognitive and physical performance. It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes. The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium are vital for the functioning of all cells in your body, especially your neurons or your nerve cells. Drinking Element makes it very easy to ensure that you're getting adequate hydration and adequate electrolytes. My days tend to start really fast, meaning I have to jump right into work or right into exercise.

20:03.056 --> 20:33.008
To make sure that I'm hydrated and I have sufficient electrolytes, when I first wake up in the morning, I drink 16 to 32 ounces of water with an element packet dissolved in it. I also drink element dissolved in water during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing, especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot and losing water and electrolytes. Element has a bunch of great tasting flavors. In fact, I love them all. I love the watermelon, the raspberry, the citrus, and I really love the lemonade flavor. So if you'd like to try element, you can go to drinkelement.com slash Huberman to claim a free element

20:33.008 --> 21:02.046
sample pack with any purchase. Again, that's drinkelement.com slash Huberman to claim a free sample pack. For me, art as a kid growing up, like the trifecta, my holy trinity of children's education, art entertainment is Mr. Rogers, Bob Ross, and then of course Pee Wee Herman. I mean, Pee Wee Herman had Lawrence Fishburne, Gary Panter, Mark Mothersbaugh, like Danny Elfman. Like he just...

21:02.146 --> 21:28.414
He was like the ringleader of all this creativity and he had like, mecca lecca hi, mecca hi, ni ho. Do you remember the secret word? The secret word was like, if anyone our age that's watching people's playoffs, it was like, today's secret word is, I don't know, what's our secret word today, Rob? Microphone. Microphone. And if someone says microphone, scream real loud. So...

21:28.642 --> 21:58.110
Can we do that today? Sure. All right. I'm counting on you. I want you to scream the loudest. And you don't take a pee until we take a pee. You got an agreement on that? Okay. All right. I hated the South Bay. I hate, like, I just, I have all the typical artist traits. I'm clinically depressed. I'm bipolar.

21:59.010 --> 22:27.230
I have all the process addictions, food, sex, gambling, shopping, workaholism. Like, I don't have, thank God I don't have any of the chemical addictions because I'm allergic to everything. But severe OCD, severe antisocial traits, you know, I just highly sensitive, you know. So I just coming here today, like,

22:27.458 --> 22:53.214
You asked me, and I kept texting. Like, I don't know, we did this, like, dance for a few months, and I, if I'm just being honest with you, like, I don't know how to not be me, you know? And sometimes, like, I put a mask on, and I'm like, I think this is what Andrew wants me to be today, but, you know, I didn't even meet you yet. And so...

22:54.658 --> 23:23.166
Every time I've done Joe Rogan or any other podcast, like, I don't know, I just feel comfortable doing my own YouTube or my own podcast. But anytime anyone else asks me, it's such a, I know who I am and sometimes I don't and sometimes I figure that out. And it's, sometimes you meet people on the street at pavilions or at the supermarket and they're like, I, and it's like this parasocial thing where it's like, I know you, I relate to you. I, and,

23:23.522 --> 23:51.966
There's something about that where, you know, the intimacy of meeting another human being and then just showing them your heart and then telling them everything. And my parents aren't going to listen to this. My brothers don't listen to it. Like, so in a weird way, like you're going to know more about me today than my own family. So the parasocial thing is even, it's real, right? Like placebo effect is real, like all these things. So I...

23:52.770 --> 24:16.862
You know, I got here early. I went for a walk down the, to those street. And then it's like just this beautiful view of the ocean. And I, I, it happens every time. It's like, it, it, I know what it makes me sound like. It's like, oh, this guy's like very unstable and unhinged. And I'm, I'd be the first to admit it. It's like, I cry all the time now. Like, I don't know what it was just like.

24:17.314 --> 24:44.318
maybe just seeing all the burned houses on the way here, just knowing that I haven't talked in a long time and there's no upside for me. And I told you that I was like, I go on these podcasts and I think, um, uh, Howard Stern, like 15, 20 years ago and Joe Rogan, the multiple times I've been on a show, I think are the only two radio shows, podcasts that have ever just aired it without editing. Everyone else,

24:45.314 --> 25:14.942
Every time you've ever heard me on any other podcast, it's either severely edited or they cut out huge chunks of it or they didn't even air it at all. So I know that, you know, and I know the world we live in today. And so there was something that went, you know, in the narcissistic traits where I'm like, I'm the fucking greatest artist in the world to like, oh my God, I'm a piece of shit. Like it just, you know, it's just like this thing. And before when I was younger, it was like, everyone has to see everything.

25:15.266 --> 25:44.894
Everyone has like, I think I'm so important that everyone has to see everything that I create, painting, podcast, book, like whatever it is. And then it went like, my problem with my shit is it's all or nothing. So it's hard for me to find the middle. And so at this point now, I'm like 49. I live a very quiet dad life. You know, I'm a family guy and there's just thousands of paintings no one's ever seen.

25:45.250 --> 26:15.102
There's hundreds of hours, if not thousands of hours of podcasts I've never put out. There's books I've written. There's TV shows, movies that I've made. It's just, I don't, before the ego and the narcissist is like, you need to put this out because you're important and everyone needs to see how important you are. And now the flip side to that, and maybe it's not healthy either, is like, I know who I am. I'm comfortable with myself. And I don't need, you know, I'm artificially,

26:15.362 --> 26:44.862
blocked from everything like I I'm I don't have my own password to my social media I don't I have blocks on my phone so I can't access the internet so it's like I do put all these things into place to like protect myself because I'm a sensitive person so um you know as an artist there's certain isms and and stories it's like oh starving artists you're not going to make any money like struggling artists there's these stories that people say and then you buy into them um

26:46.402 --> 27:16.318
But I had a few teachers along the way that influenced me that like, you know, there's like just certain moments happen in your life that live in your head rent-free. And I have a lot of those. And so one of the stories is, you know, I'm 49. It's like, you have to live in New York City. If you make it in New York, you make it anywhere. What the fuck am I doing in the 408? Like this is, what am I doing in Cupertino? Like,

27:16.962 --> 27:46.462
Like in my head, the story's written that you're a fucking, you know, and I hadn't done shit, right? But in my head, I'm like, you're a greatest artist ever in Gilroy. You know, like what? You know what I mean? Sorry, no disrespect to Gilroy. It's like the garlic capital, garlic fest, garlic ice cream, you know? So there's a story in my head that it's like, I got to get to New York City, right? Like I got to, like, I couldn't get any like leeway in Los Angeles. I'm born and raised in LA and I just, I couldn't.

27:46.850 --> 28:11.966
you know, and, and so I, I, and now I look back, if I do a inventory of the most creative explosions and the most periods of creativity in my life, it's always found in the mundane. It's always found in cold temperatures. It's always found when there's no wifi. It's always found in a suburb of

28:12.706 --> 28:42.206
It's like this story, like, I'm going to get to fucking New York, and I'm going to be part of this movement. It's never that. Like, it's nice to romanticize that, but it's these moments of brilliance. Like, someone, whoever's listening right now, they're like, I got this, and then I'm going to get to this, and then I'm going to meet this person, and I'm going to do this. And it's like, bro, I was fucking living in San Jose for seven years. I met this wonderful lady. She was my girlfriend for seven years, but, like, at that prime. I was 23, and I was like... And...

28:46.050 --> 29:15.774
for me, the stakes are so high because I, so one of the teachers was my mother, right? My mother is hardcore born again, Christian. So science does not enter the picture, right? It's like blinders on. And through her, I learned blind faith, right? Jesus Christ. That's it. There's no, there's no, so wait, you're telling me there was an actual arc with two animals and all the two animals didn't kill the other in the, you know, and there was an Adam and there was a snake that talked. It's like, yeah,

29:16.066 --> 29:45.342
Like, no hesitation. So she gave me that gift of, like, hey, science? Like, facts? No. Like, just, holy shit. Like, nothing could fault her. And you're like, you're fucking stupid. You're ignorant. But she's not. She's a bright woman. And now I look back and, like, I just met you. You're a brilliant guy. And I sit here and I go, I know some of the smartest people on the planet. You know some of the smartest people on the planet.

29:45.730 --> 30:14.814
And they're all dumb. They're all like idiots. You're like, wait, you're a genius. You have photographic memory. You created this company and you'd made some of the dumbest decisions I've ever, you know, it's like, it's like, yeah, you're really good at this, but you don't know relationships or you don't know. So, so my mom taught me through just not anything, but just watching her of just this absolute belief. And, and one of her beliefs was you're my son.

30:15.202 --> 30:44.414
You know, this is some Jesus shit like me, who is like how I explain this is fucking neurotic mess, like growing up in an unstable family and all that. Got fucking molested. Every abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, like just chaotic because they were working and I was just like left out in the wild, abandoned, spiritual abuse, all this shit. And she's just like, in the same way she believed in God and Jesus, she's like, you're the one.

30:45.378 --> 31:13.854
You're the greatest artist. And I'm like five years old. I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about? She's like, no one's better than you. No one's better than you. You're the best. You're going to be the great, you know, your name's David. Like a lot of Koreans named after Bible. She's like, I named you after King David. You're going to be a king. And I go, but now in hindsight, I'm like, and yes, King David beat Goliath, but he also was a sex addict and had a lot of mental illness and like failed a lot. You know, she didn't tell me all that shit, you know? Um,

31:14.850 --> 31:39.934
So she's raising me, she's brainwashing me. It's like, you're the best, you're the greatest. And then you, you know, I've met other artists where it's like, everyone has their own paths. Some become great because the parents are like, you're nothing. You're a piece of shit. You're the worst. You know, who the fuck do you think you are? I had the opposite. I had a mom just, it didn't matter. It didn't matter. Like, but mom, look at how horrible, it's like, you're the greatest. And so it's like, at some point,

31:40.418 --> 32:09.598
I hate myself. I have like a solo, such a low self opinion on myself. I'm just down on myself. Just this kid, just constantly getting bullied and like the world just using me. And I'm like, of course she says that she's my mom, you know, like, but she just brainwashed me into believing that I'm the best. And I would, as a trickster and a shape shifter,

32:11.714 --> 32:38.718
I would, you know, what most artists lack is like an ability to communicate with words. That's why they're such brilliant artists. And that's why they can make great music and all this because they can't, I can't, you know, like I'm going to probably talk to you for a few hours today and I'm going to leave here feeling misunderstood. I'm going to be like, fuck, did I, because I'm not, in the same way I can like translate what I feel in a painting. It's very like, it's like when people describe like ayahuasca or something, they're like, try to describe it and they're like the words that,

32:39.554 --> 33:05.726
trying to look for don't exist for what you just went through so that's kind of the why why i get really self-judgmental but i'm like this woman and you know my dad he loves me but he's like he's all right he's okay you know and i'd watch my mom who's just like a brutal business woman you know and um she would transform you know we we we you know i i spent most of my life either

33:05.986 --> 33:35.582
whore or middle class, you know, like being wealthy came later. But so, you know, we were on welfare a lot. Businesses burned down in LA riots. Like I saw my parents struggle a lot, you know, but then they would do good. And they had the gamblers mentality, which a lot of Asians do. And I have that too. Which is? Just, I don't know if this is true, but I heard that Asians have the gambling gene more than other races, especially the women.

33:35.746 --> 34:01.310
Like most women don't have the gambling gene the same way men do. So my mom would gamble like flipping houses or like not in a casino, but like just huge, like huge swings, which you're like, I grew up with a fearless woman, you know? But so we wouldn't have stuff, but then I would watch my mom open the trunk of her car and put on like

34:01.506 --> 34:31.038
fake jewelry, cubic zirconium, because she's about to go into a meeting and ask for a lot of money. And just insane lying, but hardcore Christian. So like the hypocrisy there. Like I'm definitely, I'm trying to work on my own breaking out. So it's like, I'm going to be hypocritical in this interview. And at the end, hopefully I'll be able to correct any exaggerations or lies. But that's a new tool that I have. I used to just, you know, whatever for the story, you know, I lied to tell the truth, you know, all those things.

34:31.202 --> 35:00.446
Um, so I'd watch my mom transform from like a poor woman. The mentality was, she's like, my, I'm, my son is the greatest artist in the world. And like, I'm, you know, I'm coming out of my Toyota hatchback with the broken window, you know, but I, when I go into this meeting right now, you're not going to see that. So she transformed herself into this rich, powerful woman. And they just like, get like, I'm, I'm just sitting there, a kid in the corner watching this woman get what she wants. I'm like, holy fuck.

35:00.930 --> 35:27.550
what the fuck was that performance? And then just coming out and I'm like, but mom, that's not like those things you said. That wasn't real. That's not true. And she's like, yeah, they don't need to know that. And I'm like, but we just went to church and we learned the 10 commandments and you're not supposed to lie. And it's like all this like confusion. And then I meet Sean Parker who, you know, just the sweetest kid, you know, just,

35:29.026 --> 35:57.374
He started emailing me right when he started Napster. He goes, I have all the emails. I keep certain emails and voice messages, and I just, that's my own nostalgia. But, like, I have a voicemail and a handwritten letter from Howard Stern saying, thank you for getting me into watercolors. And I was like, dude, my fucking hero. Like, yes! Like, it's such a good feeling. I have a voice message from...

35:57.730 --> 36:21.438
Tiwi Herman, which I'll share later. And all my early emails with Sean Parker, I kept just because it was, he's such an interesting, like wonderful. I know like the image of him, but like I, we don't talk like as like we used to, but I still consider him a friend and I'm forever grateful to him. But so he, I met him at a time when like

36:26.050 --> 36:52.830
I mean, I don't even know how to, I mean, like, just complete disgrace and shame to my family. You know, it's like the immigrant story. Talk to any immigrant. Why the fuck did you leave your home to come to another country? Because it was shitty there. That's it. You're not born in a country and you're like, dude, let's leave, right? The only reason why anyone's here is because it was shitty where you were at, right? Right.

36:53.282 --> 37:22.174
So then they all, it doesn't matter if you're Asian or Mexican, whatever, you came here for a better life. And what does that mean? Work your ass off. So we're in a nation of workaholics, right? This is an entire country of workaholics. So my parents, you know, I didn't go through it, but they're like, Japanese tanks rolled down the street. And, you know, they have the typical like fucking war, famine, all that stuff. So they get over here and like, born and raised in Los Angeles, you know?

37:22.658 --> 37:51.678
It's like, don't know who I am, don't know where I belong, just bullied, abandoned, abused over and over. And just, I didn't even really know the concept of suicide, but I hated myself. Like I couldn't live in my, like, it felt like I was burning inside my own body. And so even made fun of like, like I listened to, we have the same taste in music. I listened to Minutemen, Minor Threat,

37:51.970 --> 38:21.086
you know, I'm blasting, uh, down set, inside out, sound garden, slaves and bull. I used to put on sound garden, slaves and bulldozers, punch myself. It's like, just like I'm in my room, a teenager, just punching myself as hard as I can just to like go into like a berserker rage. Um, and I, and I just, back then, like I found pornography and it was just so soothing. Like it was like getting high. Like I would just masturbate like over and over again. So, um,

38:21.538 --> 38:44.318
I'm like masturbating. But I would do like weird self-harm. I guess the kids call it edging. But I'd masturbate but then not come and then beat myself up. And I'm going through puberty. And I would go out and I'd shoplift spray cans like just at, you know, hardware stores. And I'm listening to, you know, I would get like a,

38:44.514 --> 39:12.830
Faith No More, like, In Living Colors, just, like, some song, and I would just, like, an OCD, just repeat, like, some lyric in it. I am a patient boy. And I would just, like, go into, like, a trance, and I would just go out, and I would just fucking spray paint. And I'm living at home, so I'm not hiding this shit. I come home, my hands covered in black paint. This is what we fucking came to this country for? This is why we fucking left another country so you could come here?

39:13.154 --> 39:42.782
And not be an artist, but dude, like, you're a disgrace. You're a disgrace to our race. You're, you know, and my dad would just like fucking throw me against the wall. And I'm like, I don't care, dude. I don't care what you're, like, do you understand? Like, I wasn't like actively trying to kill myself, but I didn't, like, do you understand that everything you care about, I don't care. You get that? And like, you know, you start the show and I was laughing because,

39:43.138 --> 40:09.758
It's like, hey, I'm Andrew Huberman, scientist, Stanford. I'm like, I don't care. I like Andy. I like that. And then I was like, you know what? This is like a stolen valor. Sean Parker starting Facebook with Mark Zuckerberg. I'm there at the beginning. And so he brings me in. And at the time...

40:10.306 --> 40:39.294
when I first, this is years, the emails back and forth. He's like, I need, because the energy I was putting out at the time was what I'm telling you right now. Just, I don't give a fuck. I don't care what you care about. Like, I don't, like, it's just complete. I don't care if I go to jail. I don't, like, I'm just painting on everything. And it's like graffiti. Graffiti is vandal. It's not an art. It's not graffiti artist or street art. It's fucking vandalism. It's a crime. And people are telling me,

40:39.714 --> 41:09.086
Anyone out there doing street art, like, there's so many rules. There's so many, like, what did you write? Did you used to tag or anything? No, but I did. Shut up. If you skated, you definitely had, like, a. There were some kids in our crew. Cubes? No. What did you tag? Come on. No, because I had friends who were, like, graffers, and they, like, boxed us out, you know. The Undershadows kids. You never did graffiti? No, but we can talk about this later. I want to hear from you now. But later we should talk about Orphan and the Undershadows crew, which is a.

41:09.314 --> 41:38.846
which is a kind of a thing in the Bay area. Yeah. Yeah. He was a good friend of mine, but anyway, I didn't graffiti. Okay. So I grew up, I drew on my grip tape. All right. That's good. But no, I wasn't a tagger. I wasn't a graffiti guy. Yeah. So I'm out doing like that. And you know, like, you know, we can have like a conversation about creativity and this and that. And it's like, I can't, it's, it's very hard to talk about it's cause it's like,

41:39.906 --> 42:07.134
can you teach a craft? Can you teach a skill? Can I teach you to paint the Mona Lisa? Yeah. I know how to do all that. I know how to like, I went to school, like I taught myself, I watched videos. Like you could teach yourself how to paint something to make it look like something. That's a teachable skill. But creativity, where does that come from? Are you just born with it? Is it from deprivation? It's like, it's like a, you know, I could, I can only share what my path, my path is. And it's like,

42:09.218 --> 42:34.782
the embarrassment, like, you're Asian, you need to get a 4.0, you need to get into UCLA, you need to be a doctor or a lawyer, and it's like me, I'm the middle child, me and my two brothers, like, long hair, listening to heavy metal and punk, why are you doing that white shit, you know, like, and then you've got Asian kids that are into heavy, you know, it's like, there's no identity, right, and then it's just, like, lost.

42:34.882 --> 43:02.334
Just like, what the fuck is, you know, like, we don't belong anywhere. Just like the Asian depictions in media is like long duck dong. Asians have small dicks. They can't drive. They're good at math. It's just nothing's good, right? And I'm like, I, you know, I'm just trying to figure out my way in this world. And I remember Sean just was attracted to like whatever little art I'd start getting some stuff.

43:03.106 --> 43:25.214
noticed and juxtaposed and I was starting to do graffiti everywhere and and uh he's like I want that whatever that is I want that like I want to be part of that and I said and I forgot what my painting it was it was like right when I couldn't sell a painting and then all of a sudden they were selling for a couple thousand and he's like and he was a teenager still and he goes my

43:26.274 --> 43:55.998
my, I want your art, but the problem is I'm being sued right now for a trillion dollars because every single song is a, is a lawsuit, you know? I mean, whatever he, it ended up the way it ended up. But I remember he goes, I'm getting, he showed me a screenshot or whatever. He's like, I'm being sued for $1 trillion right now. So I can't really afford your art, but like, I'm going to get it, you know? So we, we started this relationship and he would send me these crazy, like abstract texts of emails of what he wanted me to paint. And then, and then, uh,

43:56.290 --> 44:24.958
He started another company called Plaxo. And he's like, no, no. And then finally you're catching me in the South Bay. You know, I met this girl, we fell in love and I moved to San Jose, just the most culturally dead place. And everyone's like rollerblading, working at Apple or MySpace or eBay or, you know, some, some tech startup. And they're like, we're cool because we have a trampoline and a,

44:25.986 --> 44:49.310
You know, we have a kitchen area where you can have all the Red Bull and snacks you want. And we have bunk beds. And that's all so you can just keep working, you know? And so I meet Sean and he's like, dude, we're starting this company called Facebook. And we finally have some money. And he's like, where are you at? And he didn't know all this, but I had just gotten out of prison. I was in jail in Japan.

44:49.506 --> 45:17.342
because I had beaten up an undercover security guard. I was 27 when I got out and I owed everyone money. I owed my girlfriend money. I owed, and so I needed money bad. And I was in like a lot of trouble. I like was, I didn't know how I was gonna pay everyone back because it's really hard to sell a painting, you know? But my paintings did sell once in a while and they were starting to get pretty expensive. And then all the art that I did in jail

45:17.922 --> 45:45.566
I used to work for Vice Magazine. I say work, but I never got paid. They didn't pay you? No, I think people, if anyone's listening, there's a little side tangent. And it's going to definitely sound like OCD, like I'm keeping a list, and maybe I am, because I don't think about it. But I was sitting the other day, and I go, they all owe me money. Everyone I've ever worked for.

45:46.146 --> 46:16.126
Like, people are like, I got to get paid. Like, someone develops a skill. Like, I'm good at songwriting or this or that. And then they go, well, I got to get, like, the young people's men. Like, well, that's my craft. I got to get paid. I go, I never got paid. I work for Nike, Levi's, Ruka, Giant Robot, Vice, fucking, even my friend, Steve Aoki. And, like, just all, every, like, 88 Rising. If I sit here, I'll name everyone. But, like, either they didn't pay me my, what they said or,

46:16.418 --> 46:42.302
or I had to threaten to kill them for them to send me or, or they just never paid me, you know? And I met Gavin McInnes when he started vice and he had seen some of the art that I did in giant robot. He saw that I went to the Congo. He saw like, and he's like, Hey, and it was all punk rock advice when it was like the big format. And he's like, dude, and he just believed in me. I don't know what he saw. He's like, dude, send me a, um,

46:42.498 --> 47:10.046
a drawing of cops beating up this and I did it fast. He's like, I need it by tomorrow. And I was like, I can do it. And then he's like, he just was like, hey, write me a story about some shooting in LA Koreatown gangster shit. And I go, but I'm not, he's like, just do it. And at one point, that was another figure that resonated my mom of like, the rules, reality doesn't apply. I'm sitting there going, wait, but I'm not a journalist.

47:10.850 --> 47:39.742
I didn't fact check anything. And there was some issues of vice where I wrote five different articles under a woman's name, a black guy's name, you know, like just made up names, articles just to fill up pages. And I would have done the comic section, illustrations, music review, street, you know, fashion, you know, the do's and don'ts. And I'm just like, you can do that. And like, I had already been

47:40.450 --> 48:04.350
groomed for that because of my mom it's like no reality doesn't apply you just my mom thinks I'm the best artist and now here's you know so Sean's like okay and and so I'm I'm in what I feel is like purgatory the 408 San Jose Milpitas you know I'm just like what the fuck is this like and I'm telling myself I gotta get to when I get to New York it's like this golden gate

48:04.546 --> 48:32.958
like end of the golden road, like wizard of Oz, like when I get there, then someone's gonna get discovered. And then someone's gonna be like, and, and, um, cause what is it? You know, like what, like people like, what is, and I go, I am a, like, I can be a hater. I can be a loving, sweet, selfless person. I could be like a very hard judgmental hater to myself. And, and so I take this so seriously.

48:33.570 --> 49:02.206
Like what we're doing here today is talking. I mean, it's mostly me talking. I could see that. But it's like we're having a conversation, but I think without sounding – it's like I think it's important. That's why I'm here. Like I said, I'm like, why? I feel like I trust you even though I just met you. But like, yeah, I fucking puked down the street because I get – I go, what's the upside? Like I'm going to talk and then maybe I say something that I didn't mean or I say it the wrong way or it gets clipped weird or edited. And I go –

49:02.306 --> 49:23.902
And I go, I think it's important. I want to come. I want to talk to you. And that's how I feel about my art. So what is that? What is art? What is creativity? And for me, it's like, I think sports are very gay, especially skateboarding. Like, if I never played sports, I would have never seen another man's penis, you know?

49:24.802 --> 49:53.758
And then in my time in sports, it was very rough because I wasn't, I told myself, any athlete that I paint with, they always start saying the same thing. I suck at drawing. And I go, why did you do that? Why did you immediately shoot yourself? Like, who said that? Did someone else say that or did you say that? They start with saying something negative. And I go, that's exactly what I say if they try to teach me how to throw a free throw. I go, oh, this is going to suck. And they go, why did you do that? And so for me, growing up, I grew up in a lot of

49:53.986 --> 50:20.830
black neighborhoods where the second, you know, I don't know how to play basketball, but the second I try and I fuck up, it's like, look at the Chinese kid fucking trying. And so I go, all right, you know what? I'm not even going to try it, you know? And it's like, well, you should have just come at like five in the morning when no one was there, you know? But like, I was so sensitive. I was like, I don't want to. So I did things in the, you know, it's art is a solitary sport for the most part. You know, I'm not, there's no Rob there. There's, it's just me.

50:22.050 --> 50:50.366
Like, like even in the thing, it's like this, like, don't look at my sketchbook. And, but in here I can fuck up and fix a race, whatever. But so like in sports, you know, it's like you're slapping guys' asses. You're taking showers with them. You're, you're doing all this like male bonding stuff. You're just spending a lot of time with other men. Right. Like, and I'm like, Oh God, like,

50:51.778 --> 51:18.334
what is the feeling? I'm trying to isolate the feeling. What, like what? And I remember, cause I, I don't like, I tell this stuff not to be like, feel sorry for me. I'm a victim. I don't feel like that. I mean, this, I'm just telling you, I'm telling you what happened. And part of it is you do like, what, what would you rather, would you rather someone beat you up for five minutes or have the whole world read your diary? You know, like these kind of, and, and,

51:19.106 --> 51:46.750
Luckily I had both, you know, I've been beaten to an inch of my life. I've had like, I've had broken bones. I've been stabbed. I've been burned. I've been like everything physically you can think of. And, and I'm still here. Right. So there's not much like I, I in like, because I have my mom's delusion, like when I talked to Joe and he's shorter than me, but I, I, I know he could probably like, logically, I know he could probably kick my ass. I have no fighting background.

51:47.202 --> 52:06.686
But in my head, I'm like, I'm pretty sure I could kick his ass. And he would fucking, and I, that's just the way I walk through life. Like, like I still believe in Santa Claus. People go, I can't believe I just said that. I don't, I think that's the first time publicly I've ever said that. We're coming up on, you know, Christmas.

52:08.130 --> 52:27.710
By now, I'm sure that many of you have heard me say that I've been taking AG1 for more than a decade. And indeed, that's true. The reason I started taking AG1 way back in 2012, and the reason why I still continue to take it every single day, is because AG1 is, to my knowledge, the highest quality and most comprehensive of the foundational nutritional supplements on the market.

52:27.874 --> 52:55.006
What that means is that it contains not just vitamins and minerals, but also probiotics, prebiotics, and adaptogens to cover any gaps that you might have in your diet, while also providing support for a demanding life. Given the probiotics and prebiotics in AG1, it also helps support a healthy gut microbiome. The gut microbiome consists of trillions of little microorganisms that line your digestive tract and impact things such as your immune status, your metabolic health, your hormone health, and much more.

52:55.202 --> 53:03.262
Taking AG1 consistently helps my digestion, keeps my immune system strong, and it ensures that my mood and mental focus are always at their best.

53:03.362 --> 53:31.998
AG1 is now available in three new flavors, berry, citrus, and tropical. And while I've always loved the AG1 original flavor, especially with a bit of lemon juice added, I'm really enjoying the new berry flavor in particular. It tastes great. But then again, I do love all the flavors. If you'd like to try AG1 and try these new flavors, you can go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman to claim a special offer. Just go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman to get started. I just remember...

53:32.962 --> 54:00.830
There's, I don't know, it's changed now, but I remember when I was a kid, it was around six or seven when they start going, there's no fucking Santa. But I was eight and I was like, and they're like, how dumb are you? And I understand this reflects back to my mom and Jesus. I go, and they go, but you've literally never got any presents from Santa. And I'd go to shame. I go, because I'm a bad kid. I cussed. I was like, I stole stuff from the supermarket, you know, like, and, um,

54:02.274 --> 54:30.366
They're like, hey, fuckface, Santa's not real. And I just was like, but he is. I believe that he is. And I believe, I go, there's, him not giving me a present is like, because I put him in this God category. Maybe he's not God, but maybe he's a God, like a demigod or something. And they go, how is he, how does he know if you're naughty or nice? I go, telepath. How does he,

54:30.498 --> 54:57.918
How does he get every fucking present to every kid in that time? I'm like, oh, he's a mutant. He can multiply. He can make copies of himself. How does he get through that tiny chimney? I go, teleport. Like, I just, it's not even a question. I just know, I believe it. And I don't care how stupid you think, like, I guess this is me coming out with my Santa Claus, but it's just like, I just believe that. And you can't say anything to make me not believe that. That's my blind faith that I got from my mom, so...

54:58.338 --> 55:27.998
Like every Christmas, I'm almost 50. I'm a fucking middle-aged man. And I go, maybe this is the year I'm going to... But now I look back and I go, the gift he gave me of giving me nothing gave me everything, right? So I'm sitting there and I'm drawing, but I have that story in my head too. Like, I suck. Oh, fuck, that doesn't look like Batman. Oh, his arm looks weird, you know?

55:28.322 --> 55:57.886
And then at some point, to this day, all the physical and emotional pain, sorry, just the physical pain, like it passes. I've broken bones. I've had my face just pummeled, like just where you wouldn't reckon, disfigured. But it passes. And if I think back, I don't remember it. But the pain that stays is like heartbreak, betrayal, abandonment. And I just remember my dad would make us keep a journal.

55:58.050 --> 56:23.710
because he just wanted us to start learning how to write. And it started with, if I take you guys to the movies, you have to write a movie review. And it was like, we were eight years old, seven years old, just, you know, today we saw Karate Kid. Johnny got chased by skeletons. The end. You know, it was like a little kid, you know, but he's like, you have to do it. Goonies was cool, you know, so we kept the thing. But then...

56:24.802 --> 56:53.022
he never asked to read it. He just wanted us to do it. And I was like, oh, so I started like getting more brave. I was like, I really liked this girl at school. And like, and I would just start getting really vulnerable and open and just knowing because my brothers don't give a shit. Like, but then the thought of like, what if someone ever read this? So I was like opening myself up and just letting, and I was like, oh my God, like it felt so good. Like,

56:53.858 --> 57:20.414
Like, I can't tell anyone, like, I'm having these kind of feelings or, like, you know, like, I fucking hate dad. You know, like, you know, whatever. And I would take the bottom drawer out of my desk out and I would hide it under there. And I shared a room with my brother, so I always did it when he, you know, I thought I was being secretive. And I was somewhere between 7, 8, 9. It just, you know, as you get better at writing and I got more...

57:21.314 --> 57:50.878
Once I got more comfortable knowing that no one, I just started writing everything. Like my brother fucking fart smell. Like I wish, you know, just like everything I would write just, just completely. And I came one day and I saw both my brothers on the bed reading it. And it, I remember my face just like, it felt so hot. Like, like I felt like someone had just like ultimate betrayal. And it was like being naked.

57:50.978 --> 58:18.622
That's why I bring up the, like, I felt more naked than being in a room full of naked guys showering, like slapping. Like it was the most vulnerable, like they were being so merciless. Ha ha, you like her and you did that. I can't believe you've, you know, cause I wrote everything in that journal. And I, I thought I, I was going to die from shame and embarrassment. And they, you know, like the way kids are brothers can be, it was merciless. And they made fun of me for years for that. And

58:19.298 --> 58:48.638
In the same way my face was disfigured and I've had physical abuse and all that, I lived through it. And I was like, I'm still here. And so why the fuck am I going to be a pussy when I draw? When I draw, no more like I'm going to draw Batman like this artist or that artist. Oh, I'm going to draw like, you know, like, okay, that's fine. You're like trying to figure out how to work with tools and that's fine.

58:48.802 --> 59:15.646
skill, craft, great. But like this, like showing you, like, so there's, I had been trained now for heartbreak, right? Like a lot of artists spend their whole life being not validated, bullied, rejected. And then finally they figure out how to draw something where people were like, yes, we like that. And so they never grow. They do that same verse, that same flow,

59:15.970 --> 59:42.718
Forever. And then you got people like Andre 3000. They're like, I don't care. I'm going to, I don't care what, you know, I'm going to do flute shit. It's like, well, we don't like that. And it's like, I don't care. I'm an artist. I'm going to, you got someone like Flea who's like, I'm going to just do performance art. And I'm like, I don't even like half that shit, but I just love them because they're, and I go, how fucking brave is that? How brave is that? But I remember just to this day,

59:43.170 --> 01:00:12.862
I am a very successful established artist. And yet today, there's people who are like, that's the fucking worst art I've ever seen. And I go, cool. But if you don't have that background of just having your heart ripped out, it is the most painful thing to put yourself out on a can, like to pour your, that's you, that's your soul. And someone's like, and then especially if you're trying to sell it,

01:00:13.282 --> 01:00:39.262
Like, no, thanks. You know? So to have a guy like Sean Parker, who's younger than me, but just not even the art. He's just like, I like you, like whatever that is. And then I want to change the world with this kid that I met, Mark Zuckerberg. And so I meet him with his flip flops and, you know, I meet the whole crew. And I go, what do you want me to do? He's like, I want you to fucking paint everything.

01:00:39.618 --> 01:01:07.806
I want people to be scared. I want investors to be scared. I want everyone to just be like, we're not MySpace. We're not eBay. I want them to be horrified when they come in here. I want you to just fucking paint the microwave, like everything. And I go, indoors, right? And he goes, yeah. And I go, all right, so just like cover up your computers. And then they're like, no, we're going to be working here. And I'm like, you know how toxic these chemicals are? Like, I work in spray paint.

01:01:08.098 --> 01:01:35.678
I have brain damage because of this shit. Like, I have, like, memory issues. They're like, we don't care. You know, they're, like, young. They're like, fuck the world, hack the world, like all that shit. Hack the world. They love, you know. So I was there, and they would be like, let's fucking blast Daft Punk. Like, I don't, this is a world I'm not, you know, I like going into different worlds, and they're like, we're going to blast Daft Punk because I guess it's, like, something with the repetitiveness and the Cody, and we're going to do these hackathons.

01:01:35.970 --> 01:02:02.270
where we just fucking hack into shit and fucking, it was punk rock. It was like a very nerdy punk rock, but they're like, we don't give a fuck. Like, and I like that spirit, but they were such nerds and they were so earnest. There was a, you've never heard people talk like that where they're talking, they're like, and we're going to change the world. And I'm like, I'm into that, whatever that is. And they thought they were so cool when they thought they were giving me a Stanford email.

01:02:02.882 --> 01:02:32.670
I go, I, I, cause I'm not on social media. Like I never, I'm a Luddite. I don't, I'm the last to whatever new technology. I'm like, all right. Like I've never touched AI, any of that. And, and so I was like, you guys are trying to be like my space, but my space is, it's already here. Like for the young people listening, like there was no Facebook, there was no Instagram. It was my space. It was just dominated. And they're like, yeah, but we're, we're fucking my space for Ivy league.

01:02:32.962 --> 01:03:00.286
you know, Oh, that's right. In 2007. That's right. Cause that was a postdoc in order to get Facebook. You had to have an Ivy league or a Stanford email. So you're not the only one motherfucker stolen valor. So I love it. So I forgot what it was. It was like Chowee at Stanford edu. And, but like, I remember he gave it. I still exist. I don't know. He's he, I remember him giving it to me. Like it's something I wanted. I was just painting. He's like, Dave,

01:03:00.706 --> 01:03:28.734
You don't have to go, I'll get you a Stanford email and then you could be part of Facebook. I'm like, I don't want to be, I don't care. I don't care what you, like, you want to be, you and Mark and all these guys want to be in this like, and they're like, he was like confused because he's like, you don't want the whatever, like respect and whatever comes with having a Stanford. And I go, no, I hate education.

01:03:28.994 --> 01:03:57.758
I hate learning. I hate teachers. I hate, like, what the fuck are you talking about? And he, he was like, I go, why don't you just make it for everybody? And he's like, oh, like, you know, the thing is like, it was so funny when the David Fincher movie came out, cause it's just an awesome movie, but it's just, I was there for all of it and just did not like some of the facts are right, but it, it just didn't go down that way, you know? But so, so Mark is like a genius and,

01:03:58.882 --> 01:04:24.478
And Sean, I mean, similar to my mother. It's like, I think Naomi's still there. It was like Naomi, Mark, Sean, Dustin, and me just like gassing them out. They're just trying to code. And I'm like listening to all their conversations and I'm like telling them how nerdy they are. I'm like, bro, make it for everybody. Don't, you know, like, and they're like,

01:04:25.282 --> 01:04:53.502
And I would listen in on all their conversations. Like, ah, so fucking cool. Dave Cho's painting our office. And I was like, oh, they like me. You know, like I'm being validated, not just by my mother, you know? And so, you know, I do everything backwards and we start to discuss payment, you know? And at that time, I had once in my life sold a painting for like 10 grand and it was like a fluke. And that's another story that I could tell about rejection and all that. But so I just...

01:04:53.826 --> 01:05:23.742
I just did some dumb, ignorant math. I was like, well, that painting was this big. And I was like, 60 grand, you know? And I needed that. I needed that to pay off everyone. And then at the time, up until going to jail, like I had been a thief. I was doing a lot of stealing to support my, like I was like, I'm, graffiti doesn't pay the bills, you know? Stealing your paint. Stealing everything. Was Facebook Office painted with stolen cans? Probably, probably. Yeah.

01:05:23.874 --> 01:05:53.694
Yes. Yes. Yeah. My graph friends, graph, graffiti for those that don't know. Yeah, yeah. They were like world-class crooks. Yeah, yeah, of course. Because they were always stealing pens and paint and, you know, I mean. Exactly. I mean, it's like it doesn't pay the bills, you know. Yeah. So what had transferred, you know, the nature of addiction, if you don't get to the root of it, it just keeps jumping, right? Like whack-a-mole. So whack-a-mole...

01:05:54.274 --> 01:06:22.398
into my background, which is watching my parents take huge... So I got into gambling. So I was just... Like, there was every paycheck, anything, it was always... I got to figure out a way... Because gambling feels like stealing. And it's, you know... And I sat there and people were just like, you work at Facebook? Like, that's... You know, my friends that aren't in that academia, they're just like, that's like the...

01:06:23.106 --> 01:06:52.638
shitty myspace you know like look at the font look at the you know all the artsy credit like look at the designs the fucking you know what is that the name facebook come on like that's the most creative you know and i said i think uh i'm gonna ask them if i could get shares in the company you know um you understand did you understand equity in that whole thing i don't understand anything and it's like i have shares in other companies that are all worthless right like it was just it was growing up with my mom watching her

01:06:52.930 --> 01:07:22.494
that if I didn't have that, like, I just, and I don't even understand that shit. I just, I remember being with, having lunch with Zuck's parents and like, you know, he doesn't, he comes from a nice family. And I think Yahoo or Microsoft, someone had offered him right in the beginning a billion dollars for it. And he's like, no thanks. And he's still sleeping on the fucking mattress on the ground, eating Doritos. And I'm like, like, you know, I'm trying to like pay my fucking, all my friends back and,

01:07:23.298 --> 01:07:51.166
I'm like, oh, he doesn't give a shit. He doesn't care about money. Like he cares about like what he cares about. It's like such a singular focus. He's like, I want to fucking disrupt the, I want to bring the whole world together. It was, you know, youthful idealism. And I remember going to work one day. I just loved working there because I don't get jobs like that where they're like paint everything. Like you're here like doing this and I'm painting around like,

01:07:51.330 --> 01:08:18.239
I'm painting on everything. And the best part is that they didn't even like what I was painting. Like Mark would come and he's like, what is that dude? And like Sean's like, Dave, you know that other thing you did I saw at the art show? And I was like, you didn't ask for that. You said fucking destroy, like you said scare people when they walk, you know. As I recall, there was like a big primate like monkey with jagged teeth and some crazy. Yeah, I was, you know, and I was gassing myself out, you know, like.

01:08:18.370 --> 01:08:45.695
like doing all that shit without a mask on. It's all going right into my brain. I'm like whoever knows whatever spray toxic spray paint fumes does to your brain and there's no fresh air coming in. And I remember Sean Parker, just bronze, just bronze skin, like $200 haircut, custom suit. And I go, who are you, man? And he was doing what my mom was doing. He was just fucking doing pushups and like,

01:08:46.786 --> 01:09:16.574
And I was like, this skinny little nerd, like just, he was like handsome. And I go, oh, this is what my mom used to do before she went into a bit. She used to fucking, and he's like, oh, we're gonna get, we're gonna fucking raise some money. Like he was, and I go, holy fuck, this guy is so sick, you know? And he transformed his physical appearance because he was about to go into like serious fundraising. And that's when I met the PayPal guy and Peter Thiel. And like, just, I was like, this guy's fucking,

01:09:16.898 --> 01:09:45.790
you know, like people give all the credit to Mark, but I'm like, Sean, guy was, he was an artist in, you know, and also like out of control, which like that attracted each other. And then he was there when they got, when he got fired and all that stuff. But I remember like the impact that had on me, like just, wow, like you heard, you've heard the fake it till you make it, right? It's like,

01:09:46.818 --> 01:10:16.702
I know I'm not the best artist in the world, but my mom thinks so. But Sean Parker, like other people think so. And I'm, but I'm like, but that's whatever. They're just kissing my ass or whatever. And then there can be a switch. And I think it's like sick and tired of being sick and tired or enough is enough. Like I just can't take it anymore. It's like, well, I can't live like this anymore. I feel like I'm trapped. I feel like

01:10:17.186 --> 01:10:46.366
And so then it's like, oh, you can't travel. You need money for that. Well, I'm going to hitchhike then. I'm going to hop on a freight train. I saw the entire world with nothing, no money. Like, well, it must be nice to be rich. I go, I'm rich now. I've had nothing my whole life, and I just had to fucking fight for it. And like, would I recommend it? Like, a lot of it was illegal. I spent a lot of time in jail, but also jail didn't hurt me. I lived, and I spent some time there. I got to learn who I am. And so it's just to peace out.

01:10:46.466 --> 01:11:13.950
the skills you learn for what's creativity, what's business, what, what aided me and helped me at this time in my life that which no longer aids me now and how to like, cause my, the other thing I learned from my mom is just, just adapts. Oh, our business just burned down in the LA riots. And instead of like sitting there, it was like, okay, now we're doing this. Now we're doing this. Now we're doing this. And I'm like, I remember getting a job in a Beverly Hills right after

01:11:14.722 --> 01:11:43.870
school I was 18 1994 and it was at this weird comic book like a high-end comic book store called comics topics I'm not a comic book guy I love comics and I remember I begged the guy for a job I'm like please please and he's like all right fine the customer seemed because I would just hang out there and talk to the customers anyways and I remember one day Stan Lee showed up and I'm like fuck Stan Lee like my hero you know and he and he sat there and

01:11:45.538 --> 01:12:15.230
People were bringing him Darkwing Duck, Batman, Archie, like all the things he didn't work on. Hey, Marvel fans. And he just signed everything. And I'm like, I was like the guy managing the line that day. And I'm looking at his hair plugs and I go, you fucking fuck. Like you didn't fucking invent Batman. You're, you know? And at the end of the day, I built up enough confidence to, you know, as everyone left and we're packing up, I'm like, Stan, dude, you didn't invent Batman. Why the fuck you signed that guy's book? And he's like,

01:12:15.650 --> 01:12:43.678
Did you see their faces? Did you see? Like they were so happy. Like why would I, why would I get in the way of their happiness? And I'm like, holy shit, dude. It's like, yeah, don't correct people. And I thought about that. Like everywhere I go in the world and there's like, China, this, I remember being in Africa and these kids were just chasing us everywhere. And our translator was a French Vietnamese guy. And he was like,

01:12:44.002 --> 01:13:12.830
Dave's Korean, I'm Vietnam. It's like, you're just, they don't give a shit, dude. They don't give a fuck. And I remember just the things I'm talking about is like watching Sean Parker's shapeshift, watching my mom's shapeshift, watching, act as if you belong, act as if you have a seat at the table. It's like, I know that's part of being an artist is being like shy, nerdy, self-conscious. It's like, just pretend like you're the best artist in the world.

01:13:13.218 --> 01:13:42.270
Like you just show up and you're like, put like, this is the journey from their head to heart. This is a, I like when you talk because you make sense, but there's, and that's why the smartest people in the world are the dumbest fucking idiots I've met because they try to apply logic to everything. And you're applying logic to spiritual problems. You're applying logic to emotional problems. And it's like, how's that working out for you? It's not, it's not, you're never gonna out think a feeling.

01:13:42.594 --> 01:14:11.646
You're never gonna outsmart a feeling. You're like, wait, these people are acting like, who would do that? Why would you do that? And I'm like, because it's not logical. It's an emotional thing. It's a mentally ill, whatever it is. It's not logic based, it's emotion based. It's mentally ill based, it's spiritual based. You can't fuck with people's religion or what they have faith in and all this stuff. So I'm watching, I remember going,

01:14:13.058 --> 01:14:39.870
Stefan correcting the black kids that he's Vietnamese is making them feel stupid and they're getting angrier. The kids that think I'm Bruce Lee and I just confirmed that I'm Bruce Lee are getting happy, right? It's like, people are dumb out there. That's fine. I don't care. I'm dumb. I'm stupid. It's like when someone corrects me, it makes me feel shame and dumber. But then if no one corrects me, it's like, then it's my own shit to figure that out or not, right? So...

01:14:40.098 --> 01:15:09.054
Watching these people, like very successful people in my life, my mom, she's like unstoppable, right? Anything the world throws at her, she just goes, okay, I guess we're doing this now. Like she doesn't hang on. She's like, hang on tightly, let go lightly, right? It's just like, okay, we were real estate people. Now we're doing Herbalife. Oh, that happened. Mark Hughes died. Okay, now we're doing this. Like she just goes like that, like adapts to any situation. And like right now I get a call a week from...

01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:37.598
all artists, creative types that they're, it's, you know, and we don't have to have an AI talk. I don't, I would rather not have an AI talk, but it's Armageddon, right? Everyone's like, I spent my life doing sound engineering and now it's gone. Just like the guy who would do the like hand letter this and then Photoshop, boom, your job's gone. The Carl Zeiss lens go on the iPhone and now photographer. Like it's just, it's gone. Like you could sit there and start complaining or you could just keep adapting. And so I,

01:15:37.922 --> 01:16:01.566
I think true creativity you can't contain. If you're open and you're ready to get naked and you're ready to, you know, people are like, oh, do you have to suffer to be a great artist? Absolutely, but you've already suffered enough. It's already done. Like, whatever happened to you in your childhood, that's enough fuel for the rest of you. You don't have to continually. But I see myself and others at times, like, I hopefully am better now, but I see people.

01:16:02.178 --> 01:16:28.190
continually putting themselves in a situation to like suffer more and more and more and i and i just i just remember the the shame of my my like it's just these things they're they're they're you know decades ago but they're still like my dad just like throwing me across like we left another country so you could be a criminal event like just

01:16:28.578 --> 01:16:58.302
He was like, I'll just kill us all now. We were in the car leaving the police station. He's like, I'm going to crash the car. And I was like, I was in the back, like kind of disassociating, numb, crying, like feeling mixed emotions. Going from like victim to sorry to like, well, fuck you then. And you know, everything in between. And then just going, I accept now. Oops. I accept. Sorry. Am I close enough to the microphone? You're good. Am I close to the microphone? Ah!

01:16:58.402 --> 01:17:27.486
Just going, I'm gonna choose to believe what my mom believes in me. I'm the greatest artist on the planet. I was in my 20s, I was like, fuck it. Like, going into galleries, looking at comic books, and can I tell you one quick fuck you Sean Parker story? So at the time I was doing Facebook, like things were happening. Like I had a Vice show selling my jail art, which

01:17:27.746 --> 01:17:54.014
gave me a little bit of cash. I was starting to work for Heidi Fleiss to do a erotic mural for her sex shop in Hollywood. And I had just gotten a job to do Jay-Z, Linkin Park's mashup album cover. And it's like, I needed the money and I need, and it was just like, it things, I was like, it's starting to happen. Like things are, you know, and, and this is while I was doing the Facebook thing. So they hadn't blown up yet, you know, and, uh,

01:17:55.106 --> 01:18:25.086
They gave me the job and I'm like, the biggest rock band in the world and the biggest rapper in the world are doing an album together and they want me, little old me to do the, I felt so, I mean, they fucking butchered the art, I gave them the art and they just made it look shitty, they put a shitty font on it, they put a, like, they did fake graffiti, I was like, what the fuck did, whatever, anyways, that's a whole other thing, but, you know, I'm like, cool, like, what's that gonna pay, like,

01:18:25.602 --> 01:18:51.742
And they're like, two grand. I'm like, wait, you know, it's like this, one day I'm going to make it and my name is going to be in lights. And I knew other artists. So like Mir did the Limp Bizkit cover, Shepard Fairey did. So I knew them well enough where I was like, hey guys, am I getting fucked right now? And they're like, no, that's typical. I go, that's what they pay artists for?

01:18:52.354 --> 01:19:20.798
I mean, because back in the day when I was doing art, paintings, whatever, galleries or illustrations, that was the range, 200 to like 2,000 at the most if you're doing like a cover or something. But I'm like, an album cover for? And they're like, no, that's what they pay. And I was like, damn, dude, I thought this was big time, you know? And so I negotiated for that at the same time I'm working at Facebook and I drew this crazy cover.

01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:48.350
And they're like, yeah, that's for the rights for the album cover, right? So then, I don't know, the album comes out and then they use the art everywhere. They use it on billboards. My friend's reading comic books and he's like, oh, they did a full page ad. And I go, like for illustration, that's a separate fee, right? It's like, here's the rights to use on the album cover. Here's for advertising, right? And so I'm talking to, I don't know anything, right? I'm a fucking horrible street artist. Oh, I call myself a street artist.

01:19:48.770 --> 01:20:16.158
Delete that from the microphone. Sorry. So I'm, you know, and you could like bleep the names or whatever, because I clearly remember. So I call Warner Brothers and I go, hey, can I talk to whoever's in legal or whatever? And I go, yeah, I talked to my friends who are also artists that are more successful. And they said, there's a separate fee I should be getting for billboards.

01:20:16.482 --> 01:20:45.182
you know, bus bench usage, magazine editorial, you know, you know, magazines used to be big, you know, Tower Records, Virgin Records. Sure. And I remember the arrogance on this guy, Chip. He was like their head legal. He doesn't work there anymore. And he's like, and I remember the way he talked to me felt like my child, like just made me feel, he's like, you're some shitty graffiti. Like, who the fuck are you? You know, like, why am I wasting my time talking to you? And I go, well,

01:20:45.858 --> 01:21:14.334
And he started like just hitting me with legalese. And I go, hey, I'm raising my hand right now. You can't say I'm raising my hand saying, I don't understand what you're saying. Can you please talk to me? And like, can you dumb down? Like you're trying to beat me up with words right now. I'm just saying, you know, it should be an additional 10 grand, 15 grand for what you guys did. I'll be happy with another five or, you know, just like trying to talk. And he's like, I don't know who the fuck you think you are. And it was like very condescending.

01:21:14.690 --> 01:21:44.510
And I remember the arrogance of, I was like, I could be recording this call, you know, but he was just, and I was like, for a guy named Chip, that's such a weird, you know, you could come at us with lawyers. You could, like, and you may be even right, but guess what? You're fucking with Warner. Like, you'll never win. Like, you will never get another dime out of us. I was like, holy fuck, that, what a fucking, and like I said, like, if you're going to be, like, people are like, oh, I love painting, then just paint.

01:21:45.058 --> 01:22:14.302
Like, oh, I want to be, it's like, you know how fucking hard it is to make money as a creator? It's like, you got to fight, you got to get a thick skin and you better be ready to, like, I had to threaten Nike with blowing up their entire parking lot before they paid me. I was like, you asked me for these drawings. I did them. I delivered them on time and you're giving me the checks in the mail. And I called like Wieden and Kent, you know, whatever, Oregon. And I was like, I live in LA. It's going to take me this many hours to drive. And I'm going to, I don't know which car is yours. I'm going to blow up every car,

01:22:14.626 --> 01:22:42.814
was in the mail the next day i'm like why did i have to do that why did i have to turn into my mom to get the but most artists go and then they just get fucked over right so that's part of being an artist is getting fucked over not getting paid what you deserve blah blah blah so i'm like obviously sensitive and painting like in a bad mood and sean's like what dude what's up dave why you and i told him what i just told you and he's like you know facebook has like big money behind it now it's growing he's like oh we got a

01:22:43.234 --> 01:23:12.382
multi-million dollar deal with Warner Brothers tomorrow in the meeting. And I was like, he goes, check this out. So he has the meeting with Warner Brothers and they're like full, like, you know, everyone's at the long table and they're like, oh, we want to advertise with Facebook and this is the new, this is the new world and they're like, okay, cool. And it's like, you know, it's like millions of dollars or whatever, hundreds of thousands of dollars. And he's like, yeah, but that guy Chip fucked with my friend Dave Cho. So we're not doing shit with you guys. And he just, and I was like,

01:23:14.562 --> 01:23:44.542
this guy's my dog forever. Like, like what, how, like, like just does not, no fucks given. Right. I was like, I cried. I gave him a hug. I was like, don't fuck with me. Don't fuck with me. Like it felt so good. It felt so fucking good. I was like, and then I found out he got fired and all that shit. It's like, I was like, yes, sometimes the little guy wins, you know, like it felt so good. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors function.

01:23:44.706 --> 01:23:49.854
Last year, I became a function member after searching for the most comprehensive approach to lab testing.

01:23:50.178 --> 01:24:20.144
Function provides over 100 advanced lab tests that give you a key snapshot of your entire bodily health. This snapshot offers you with insights on your heart health, hormone health, immune functioning, nutrient levels, and much more. They've also recently added tests for toxins, such as BPA exposure from harmful plastics, and tests for PFASs, or forever chemicals. Function not only provides testing of over 100 biomarkers key to your physical and mental health, but it also analyzes these results and provides insights from top doctors who are

01:24:20.144 --> 01:24:48.126
expert in the relevant areas. For example, in one of my first tests with Function, I learned that I had elevated levels of mercury in my blood. Function not only helped me detect that, but offered insights into how best to reduce my mercury levels, which included limiting my tuna consumption. I'd been eating a lot of tuna, while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine, both of which can support glutathione production and detoxification. And I should say, by taking a second Function test, that approach worked.

01:24:48.226 --> 01:25:03.454
Comprehensive blood testing is vitally important. There's so many things related to your mental and physical health that can only be detected in a blood test. The problem is blood testing has always been very expensive and complicated. In contrast, I've been super impressed by function simplicity and

01:25:03.554 --> 01:25:28.030
at the level of cost. It is very affordable. As a consequence, I decided to join their scientific advisory board and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast. If you'd like to try Function, you can go to functionhealth.com slash Huberman. Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people, but they're offering early access to Huberman podcast listeners. Again, that's functionhealth.com slash Huberman to get early access to Function.

01:25:28.898 --> 01:25:55.710
So I got all the typical shame and all that. And to be fair, if you're my dad and you fucking escaped a war and famine to raise your family in America and you see your kid stealing paint at Home Depot to graffiti dicks on walls, like you're going to, you're not going to. So I give him that, you know, but I just, I was, I felt, I didn't know where I belonged. You know, I'm like, I, I,

01:25:56.194 --> 01:26:21.374
I couldn't process, maybe I have dyslexia. I was in school and it just, I couldn't, none of the information. I was like, this is so hard. Like people, like I would try really hard to get a C, right? Where other people were like, oh, okay. You know, X. I was like, why is there an X in math? And they were like, Dave. And they'd dumb it down and dumb it down. I'm like, I'm retarded. I think I need to go to that class. Like I'm, like I felt,

01:26:22.626 --> 01:26:52.158
Like, I felt... Because both of my brothers have, like, really high IQs. And I'm like, I'm stupid. Like, I... You know... So I felt really small in that area. And I made up the story. Like, I suck at sports. I go, so this is it. This is all I'll ever be good at. So I... And now I'm going to fully buy in to what my mom's saying. And because I grew up with the Asian work ethic, like... I'm like... It's not a... I am good. I... It wasn't like I am going to be the best. I was like... I just...

01:26:52.418 --> 01:27:21.886
adopted I am the best artist in the world and to that power of thought like I sat down and I'd go to museum I studied everything I studied comic book art, cereal boxes, museums, fine art, why does this I just got into the business side of art the creativity, fucking loose watercolors like tiny detailed pen draw like everything and I was like and I was like overcome I'm like I'm gonna be good at all of it oil painting like there so people go what kind of artist I'm an artist everything

01:27:22.530 --> 01:27:51.358
When I talk, when I make music, like I am going from I'm a piece of shit, I suck to like, like, you know, not healthy, but you know, it's like, I am art God, you know, like, and so I was like in my 20s, just like brainwashed, like waking up and then like, that's not how I naturally woke up. I woke up like, oh fuck, you know, and I'd wake up and I'd have to put that on like, you're the greatest, you know, like, um, hypnotizing myself. You're the best. You're the best.

01:27:52.738 --> 01:28:22.110
You're the greatest. Were you doing any like reading books? Because at the time when you and I are basically the same age, back then, it wasn't a lot about like neuroscience and this and that and like actualization. It was all kind of hidden away. But there was this, there were, there was like the Tony Robbins type stuff. And there was this idea and infomercials and stuff that like that you could program your mind. Sounded like you just basically took all that on without any of that.

01:28:22.210 --> 01:28:51.390
Yeah, I didn't read any of that stuff. I stole lots of books and I would read a lot of pornography. I guess this kind of can... I could fit my Pee Wee Herman story if we're talking about publishing. It's hard to talk about this because kids ask me all the time, like, how'd you make it in art? And like nothing I did applies to today. You know, it's like I went to Kinko's. I would have to spend my money or figure out how to do that copy thing, that trick to make more copies because color copies are 99 cents. It's like who has...

01:28:52.034 --> 01:29:21.278
So I'd have to pick which one of my paintings were the best, make these like mini color copy packets. So that's $10. And then I would go to the newsstand and write the address, like Rolling Stone, like all the magazines that had prestige and like CF Payne, Kent Williams, Baron Story, like all these amazing illustrators that would work for Time Magazine, Rolling Stone, Playboy, like they would all use. So I would open the front page where it had the heading of art director and I would write it down and

01:29:21.762 --> 01:29:51.646
the newsstand guys, like, I sound like a boomer right now. Like, you know, it's like, who the fuck, like, there's kids listening right now. There's a magazine. What's that? You know, but that's what I had to do. And I would be like, which magazine do I want to send this $10 packet that I just, and then I have to mail it to him. Hopefully like they get that letter and not some other department, you know, and then you just rejection letter after, you know, like, sorry, sorry, sorry. And, um, so I'm, I'm, I'm sitting down and I'm,

01:29:53.218 --> 01:30:22.302
I'm like, I'm ingesting all this and I have the, I have the fire and I'm like sitting down and I go, that, like what, why is that drawing successful? Why do, you know, and of course there's tons of insider trading and corruption in the art world, but I didn't know that at the time, right? It's like, oh, that guy's dad owns fucking water. Like that guy, you know? So I would just sit there and I would be like, that guy drew this much. I'm going to draw 10, like,

01:30:23.042 --> 01:30:52.990
I did this and I'm going to draw, you know, and I just, some of my paintings, all my paintings back then had like at least seven layers, if not more, just layering and layering and dance. And it was me. It's like a musician that's like, I have to, like, I saw a thing with Rick Rubin and Flea doing Give It Away Now. And he was just like, you know, he can do, but he was like, just do there, like just play less. And back then it wasn't, it was like, I need to show everyone what I'm capable of, which is,

01:30:53.282 --> 01:31:22.334
I can draw better than you. I can paint. I have to show you that. Now I don't care. But back then it was, and it isn't that. Art is a, it's not who can put the most lines down or, you know? And so I'm trying to, I'm trying to like, and it was just, everyone has their own path. But I remember year 2000, I'm doing graffiti. I'm getting some gigs to do murals. You know, it's just slowly starting.

01:31:22.626 --> 01:31:49.630
someone contacted me at Marvel Comics. And I was like, man, I didn't even try. And like, this is it. This is my dream. And they were, we want you to draw the X-Men, but like a cool, cool X-Men. I'm like, fuck, I didn't even have to go to portfolio day. I didn't have to, you know, and I go, oh, I knew if I just kept putting my shit out there, you know, but I'm, you know, I'm what, 23 at the time, you know? And I start drawing it and I guess they fired me.

01:31:49.730 --> 01:32:18.718
They didn't fire me, they just decided to use a different artist, but they never told me. So I'm still drawing it. And I'm, you know, I'm a passive aggressive angry kid already. And I didn't email, some people had emails, but a lot, like a lot of artists hadn't, this is the beginning of the internet. Like people weren't using it the way they do now. And I remember it was like the first message board where my friends were like, Hey Dave, you got fired off the X-Men book. And I go, how did you know? And they go, you don't use the internet? And I go, what is that?

01:32:18.818 --> 01:32:48.286
And they showed us, and I felt shame again. I was like, oh, my God. Like, I was so excited to... Like, there's little things in my head. Like, if I do a comic book, that means I made it. And I wrote the most scathing, homophobic, racist. Like, just, I was mad. I thought it was funny. I was 23 at the time. And it was, like, 10 pages long. But I didn't know the editor of Marvel. It's probably not even him. It was just... And I didn't know how to get it to him. So I just...

01:32:48.674 --> 01:33:17.950
to marvel's website and i just sent it to every single person that works at marvel like copy paste and the next day was my first experience in the year you know y2k 1999 2000 of going viral they're like every artist i look up to every writer i look up to in comics was like we don't know who the this kid is but he just committed career suicide and then once again shame and so like if i go back to all my shame stories i go what's what's the through line and

01:33:18.082 --> 01:33:47.038
should have made the secret word shame but um oh I'm a shame chaser like I get high off shame like what's my drug oh workaholism it's like my my drug that I've chased my whole life is shame and anger like fucking powerful drug you know and so I I couldn't believe it I was like I'm never gonna get to draw the Hulk Spider-Man Wolverine and I have and I have at this point and I went through the back door which I always do it's true true vandal but I

01:33:47.618 --> 01:34:14.078
just remember going holy fuck this is the worst day of my life like people that I look up to they're like there was like a whole thing of like I don't know who this Dave Cho I've never heard of him but he's a horrible human being listen you know and I was like but there was context like you should have heard how I saw heard it in my head like I was you know and they're like oh it looks different and I was like holy fuck and that was my first experience of like of just feeling like

01:34:15.426 --> 01:34:44.958
Like me following a pattern of trying to replicate hatred towards me. Like if it's... But not knowing it. I'm just like, oh, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. And like some ignorance, some playing dumb, some like repeating patterns like a monkey without knowing. And so I had a friend in comics at the time because I was just like, I don't... I was just making art. I was going out doing graffiti every fucking night, just doing that OCD, playing music in my head and just...

01:34:45.762 --> 01:35:15.582
Bagging up everything. Like the kind of graffiti you're not supposed to do. People's cars, houses. Like I wanted someone to kill me. Like I didn't care. Like I wanted someone to be like, dude, I worked hard for that car and you just ruined it. And in my head, I'm like, but I'm a famous artist, which I wasn't. I'm 23. And they're like, I just made your car more valuable. That's how I'm thinking. But I was out of my mind. You probably did make their car more valuable in retrospect. Can I ask you a question about the shame? Absolutely. I have a friend. He's a...

01:35:16.450 --> 01:35:43.966
Addiction trauma counselor guy, amazing guy. He's been on this podcast, his name is Ryan Suave. He has a gift for helping people understand trauma and addiction and this kind of thing. We haven't talked a lot about addiction yet today, but you said you got addicted to the shame. And do you think, I mean, who knows? Here I'm using my intellectual brain, but do you think that these oscillations of like,

01:35:44.642 --> 01:36:12.382
your mindset, like I'm a great artist, I'm the greatest artist, sets it up so the shame is that much deeper. Like it's like loading a spring. Because he told me once, Ryan once told me, he's worked with heroin addicts, drug addicts of all kinds, sex addiction, everything. And he just said, you know, he goes, gambling addiction is the worst because the next time really could change it all. And he said, but there's something really interesting about

01:36:13.090 --> 01:36:42.174
happens to gambling addicts he goes eventually they get tired of winning and they get addicted to losing happens really quick so um i have my own feelings about this subject i'm a severe gambling addict like um i told you i'm going to time jump so i'm at the you know i'm at that point but i'll jump to the current which is which is a very shameful thing for me to

01:36:42.306 --> 01:37:11.646
admit or talk about, but I'm here, so I'll just go there. Shame is so powerful because at this point, I've been to all the 12-step meetings. I've been to Debtors Anonymous, Business Owners, Debtors Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Workaholics, Sex and Love Addicts, Sex Addicts, Gambling, like every single and so what's the through line?

01:37:12.770 --> 01:37:38.814
every single one is gambling. Every single addiction is gambling addiction. If you drink and drive, you're gambling. Your life could be over and you're, you know, if you overeat and you're diabetic, it's just every fucking addiction is. So it's addiction is one of those things you can't apply logic to. And your, your scientist friend nailed it. It's as I explore my feelings, you know, cause the, the,

01:37:39.042 --> 01:38:08.670
well what are you running from Dave? I was like well I'm fucking running from myself dude I don't want to look in the mirror I don't want to see myself I hate myself so I'm just running so as long as I'm like doing graffiti running from the police you know just hopping on a train like literal running like literally running to make sure I'm never sit still for one second like what are you doing Dave? I'm playing drums in a band I'm fucking you know at a casino I'm

01:38:08.802 --> 01:38:35.966
traveling, doing the news for Vice, I'm painting at this, like, I can't, I can't sit still, because that means I have to sit with myself, and I can't do that. I can't do that. I couldn't do that. I couldn't do that. I can now. So, you know what feels good? Winning a lot of money.

01:38:36.770 --> 01:39:03.934
not working for it and sitting down at a casino and them knowing who you are and upping the limits and you literally making enough money off Baccarat or Blackjack what people don't make in a lifetime. That's a fucking, that's an insane feeling. How many shits do you think I took today before I came here? Rob, how many? Two. Two, one big one and one little one.

01:39:06.242 --> 01:39:34.846
Scientists don't know what causes IBS. I do. It's stress. When I was gambling, when I was at the height of any of my addictions, seven shits a day at least. Just like, okay, like just like, and you would never see it on my face or maybe you would, but I felt like I could gamble with a fortune in front of me and lose it and win it and like,

01:39:35.874 --> 01:40:02.110
Nothing. Nothing. Like, I was, you know, disassociated, dead inside, whatever you want to say. I didn't feel anymore, right? Like, the highs were so high. I had already been chased by the cops. I'd already been beaten the shit out of. I've already been molested before. I already... Whatever you could do to me, you've already done to me, and I'm still here. What can you do to me that I... Like, I'm my worst enemy. Like, I beat myself up, right? Right?

01:40:03.426 --> 01:40:26.942
the gambling stopped when i got into recovery when like i take one shit a day now when this fucking asshole asked me to do the podcast i start stressing i've taken what was that like a few weeks ago it's it oh shit dude i just took three shit that started again because i don't have stress in my life anymore or like i have whatever normal family stress but i don't have

01:40:27.714 --> 01:40:56.638
oh, you're going to say something on some guy's show and then your life's going to be ruined again. You know, like that's, I've done that so many times. It's like, so I'm like, fuck, I just woke up. I just already took a shit. Why do I take another one? I'm like, oh, the IBS is coming back because there's a part of me that's like, I hope I say something horrible today because then I could feel that again. And so what people, when they're listening to this and I don't know if I'm making, when I talk, sometimes I make sense to myself and sometimes I don't, but

01:40:57.346 --> 01:41:26.814
If you're an addict, it will make sense to you. Everyone listening to this is either an addict or someone in their life is, like their family member or their friend. But at this point, with social media and their phones, everyone's an addict, right? You can't stop. It's just impossible. You will never find anything more addictive than a phone, right? So in the time that, like I haven't been in an actual casino in 10 years, I've banned from all these casinos, the whole world became a casino. You can't go anywhere without gambling that little.

01:41:26.914 --> 01:41:56.766
lottery you can go on your phone you could bet on you know anything right so so at first in every addiction you want to win oh fuck that you know I can't I can relate to drugs and alcohol even though I don't do that but like that must feel good to like get a little drunk and then be the funniest guy at the party or so eating the most delicious foods that I ever ate that I never thought I would eat in my life and then

01:41:57.346 --> 01:42:26.686
okay, that's good. Your body feels good. Why do you need to eat until you're puking and you become like binging and purging? Like what... Because what you don't understand because you're applying logic to it is I want to fucking hurt. I want the... Like winning a million dollars feels fucking great. Losing $10 million feels even better. Well, that doesn't make any sense. Like getting married feels awesome. I mean...

01:42:27.010 --> 01:42:56.318
I'm just making shit up, but like put like greatest day of my life, right? Like greatest day of my life. And I could get dark. I'll try not to use dark examples, but when something awesome, marriage, having a child, winning a lot of money, doing drugs and having one of the best days of your life, like just when it's on the good side, it feels, that's why you do it. Heroin fucking feels good. I've never done it, but the description of it is like,

01:42:56.578 --> 01:43:26.526
sounds awesome why would you not do it again but then when you're fucking scratching your skin and sucking dick for fucking crack like that's another high where you're at the bottom and that's a repetition of the pattern of whatever your childhood was and so I don't fucking know Andrew besides his online persona right like where this is our first time meeting in person it's like I this is not me being a know-it-all like humans are not that

01:43:26.754 --> 01:43:54.174
difficult to understand. We're very simple. Like, I called him immature a little bit before, not to be insulting. It's just like, part of me is like, this is me being a hater. Like, I love everybody, but I'm just like, what fucking adult gets tattoos? Like, what kind of fucking adult gets? And I know you got fucking tattoos. I'm like, who fucking just like throws their shit away to become a skater? And then,

01:43:56.386 --> 01:44:24.606
Are you okay with me asking you questions? Sure. Were you sexually abused? No. I mean, I knew. I had friends that were. I lucked out. I had one guy come at me that I worked at a skateboard shop in Palo Alto. Maybe you saw it at Palo Alto Toy and Sport. It was down on Waverly Street. The guy that worked there did that. I responded differently. I flipped the desk over on him. I made him apologize to me in front of everybody. And my biggest fear...

01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:50.782
at that point was my mom, even though we had our attention, my mom's from New Jersey. She's old school. She knew something happened. And my fear was that if I told her that she would actually kill him. Like actually kill him. And because despite whatever challenges she and I have had over the year, like that maternal aggression, that protectiveness, she would have killed him. So I remember being,

01:44:51.938 --> 01:45:21.342
like not worried about me, worried that she was going to kill him. You know, and then, but no, I lucked out there. I perceive you as a brilliant man. And this is me gathering data and facts in my life. Not, I don't know what the, but you know, you know, very smart. I know geniuses, you know, geniuses, the smarter the person, the more intellectual they are, the more on the spectrum they are, the greater the trauma they experience because-

01:45:21.986 --> 01:45:50.494
whether that was always in them and the trauma unlocked it, or you learn that as mental jujitsu to like these people I know in my life that are just brilliant. Like they're just, they can comprehend things that most people can, they could create their childhood was so fucking unsafe, abandonment, you know, and usually that's why I asked you about it's usually sexual trauma because that's, that has carries the most shame that they're like, Oh, it was small. I couldn't defend myself that, um,

01:45:51.202 --> 01:46:19.454
unless I become like a jujitsu master or fighter, how can I protect myself? And it's with this. So then something gets unlocked here and they become the smartest person in the room and they can just destroy you verbally. They can destroy you in a courtroom. They can just, and, and, and so, yeah, to answer the, you become a shame chaser. You get high off shame. And it's like, that's even shameful to admit out loud. And so, yeah,

01:46:20.194 --> 01:46:49.054
Like I could sit here and like if I'm being present with current, with up to date, like I have a great life. Like I'm telling you a lot of stories from the past, feelings that I felt in the past. And I have, you know, I tell on myself all the time. When old patterns come up, I, you know, I have a therapist. I got a men's group. I got friends who love me. I raise my hand. I go, I need help, which I never did before. I grew up with shut the fuck up and figure it out. That's my whole, my whole childhood was a question mark.

01:46:49.602 --> 01:47:18.462
are we going what are we doing nothing was explained to me and so there was a lot of violent a lot of abandonment it's just like and so I just everything and that's probably why I'm really curious and ask a lot of questions because I didn't know what was happening and my parents were just like working all the time they're like I don't know stay at this house or this and I was just like who are these people like what's happening what's why is this guy baptizing me for the 10th you know like why am I getting on a plane it was just like it was just like

01:47:18.562 --> 01:47:46.654
just shut up, just go along to get along. And so part of my story is if I'm a nice boy, if I'm a nice Asian boy and I do, then the world shits on me, then everything horrible. The second I fucking speak up, scream, get the fuck off, like just do graffiti, break the law, then I get to do the Linkin Park album cover. Then I get Sean Parker. It's like,

01:47:47.074 --> 01:48:16.510
you know, I talked to all the jackass guys about this. It's like, you're rewarded for bad behavior. You get to be the president. You get to, you know, like the more I act. And it's so in one way, okay, that's for career, right? But like, what about, it just runs hell on your personal life. And that's why when I, when I'm in my addiction and I'm chasing shame, I drag everyone who loves me down with them. So I go, I need to, and I don't need my wife or anyone to be my mom. Like, I'm like, I,

01:48:16.802 --> 01:48:46.718
I'll handle it. That's how I grow myself up. And it doesn't need to be like, like I said, brilliance is found in Milpitas and Palo Alto and Gilroy. Brilliance is found in the mundane, sitting in the waiting room. Brilliance is found in these like quiet moments. And so it's like, I don't need to go to rehab and have like this fucking movie role kind of, it's just like, it's a phone call. It's like, let me do this. And so the feelings, the chemistry that it's like, when,

01:48:47.266 --> 01:49:17.054
When you lose all the money you've ever made in your life in a coin flip and you're just sitting there like. No worries. Hopefully I didn't get any on the microphone. What's that line from that 80s movie? It's not a party till something's broken. I always like that line because it excuses it immediately. Some breaks, folks. You say, yeah, in this case, it was my soul, you know.

01:49:17.410 --> 01:49:45.854
So I was very reckless with my heart. I treated myself very poorly. I didn't care for, I didn't care what happened to me. And so as I jumped from addiction to addiction, it's like, well, which is the one I could hide in plain sight? The one that you're in right now, workaholism. As long as you work all the time, as long as you're providing people, as long as you're helping people and being of service, then that's good, right? Right.

01:49:46.338 --> 01:50:14.462
what is being neglected in that this like I mean I don't tell this to everyone but like someone in your situation that you know you have life changes coming up and I already know your answer but I would I would ask why not take one year off like why and it's like well I got my this and I'm an important Stanford guy and I got yeah but that will like like you only got one life and you know there's something about it

01:50:16.546 --> 01:50:43.998
that feels like when I'm in my workaholism, like that's the one where I get in this society a pat on the back. Good job, Dave. And the Sean Parker story with the Warner Brothers, that was a win. I was like, fuck yeah. But it was so much. Can you tell my Pee Wee Herman story?

01:50:44.706 --> 01:51:14.526
some shame in that. I'll bring it around. I just don't, you know, part of my character defects is entitlement and impatience. Like, I just, once I accepted what my mom is saying true, I am the greatest artist in the world, according to Jane Cho. And now I'm going to start, you know, not at first, but like, I'll start to believe that too. Because you got to, it's so scary doing graffiti. You know, not in a crew, not in a gang.

01:51:15.010 --> 01:51:41.726
just go out and it's like it's something so comforting to draw in a tiny sketchbook and no one's gonna see it right you fuck up whatever but to draw something big on a wall and everyone going down the 101 freeways like thousands of people will see it before eight o'clock like that sucks that guy has no can control that guy and you're just like you're you're naked you're like this is what's inside me and i did it 40 feet long and here it is and they're like it sucks

01:51:42.818 --> 01:52:10.590
Shame. I'm chasing shame. Like, it's like, what would it feel like if everyone's like, dude, that's the fucking masterpiece. Not as cool. Not as cool. So I, I'm just, I'm doing the thing. I'm sending my art out. And La Brea used to have a lot of galleries. And I, and I, and in my head, I thought my art was better than every artist that was in those. I would be like, and I'd go down the street and I'm like, oh, they show that. I would,

01:52:10.754 --> 01:52:40.638
a record of what kind of art they show that I'd skate back to my house and paint like that style but better in my mind better and then I'd make a new portfolio and I'd go down like and they're like who the fuck like like it's like adult like you have to be shown first before they'll even take and I go but you know so it's just anger more frustration coming out sideways coming out doing more graffiti shoplifting food to like you know so then I finally get to La Brea and Melrose where there was a

01:52:40.770 --> 01:53:08.350
ice cream shop called Double Rainbow and there's this wonderful lady named Candice there and I was saying how I'm talking now like out loud and my art's just right here and she's like let me see and I show it to her and she's like this is amazing I go I fucking know dude I'm the best and she's like alright shut the fuck out alright she's like put it up on the wall and then my ego goes in a fucking ice cream shop and I go well I guess no one else is offering that okay so it was like not this it wasn't like

01:53:09.346 --> 01:53:37.150
minimalist it was floor to ceiling hundreds of paintings some that i spent months on like this was singular just i'm the best and i need to show you it wasn't like tasteful like here's one painting and let that breathe and it was just like here's you know and people are coming in there buying like mint chocolate chip going that's pretty cool you know and so every day i would get a call love your art

01:53:37.570 --> 01:54:04.318
want to buy it. I'm like, fuck yeah, here we go. Like, $2. I'm like, you know how long I spent on that art? And, you know, and I just was like, 50 bucks? You know, I'm 23. This is like early 2000s. I'm like, that's less than the art supplies. That I stole, to be fair. But still, I'm like, can you cover the cost of materials? And they're like,

01:54:05.218 --> 01:54:34.494
yeah, that's good, but, you know, can you just, like, haggling, like, five, ten. I'm like, that's what a fucking print or sticker costs. Like, this is an original painting, you know. And I remember I got a call one day, and it's these things that I keep, the stories that I keep editing in my mind to make me the hero, you know. And the guy's like, I'll trade you a car for, like, that giant painting, the one that I spent months on. And, of course, it's, like, 1972 Plymouth Fury, no brakes, no brakes,

01:54:34.882 --> 01:55:02.878
Like cracked wind, you know, just a complete fucking beater, like piece of shit. But then the story in my head that I go around telling, you know, part of my PR marketing is like, I traded my art for a car for an, you know, oh yeah. And I'm like, you don't need to know the details of the car, you know. And the guy in the, you know, recycler was trying to sell it for like two, $300, you know. He's like, just get this shit off my lawn, you know. And I remember this is how I drove it. I would drive it and there was no brakes. So I had to...

01:55:03.042 --> 01:55:32.894
It was like fuel and I had to pump it like a block before or, and then I would always hit the car like ding. Like that's what, and the guy would say, hey, what the fuck? And I'd be like, sorry. And I had no money to fix it, but I was just in my head. I did it. I fucking, I did it. I, you know, like small victories, little victories. And then my friends like, like I knew all like the indie zine, like make your own fucking punk rock.

01:55:32.994 --> 01:56:01.054
And I would just get rejection letter after just the continuation of you're not enough. Your art's not that good. You suck. Maybe they wouldn't say that, but that's how I took everything. Not at this time. Not for us. Rejection letter from Playboy, from Rolling Stone. And I just remember one of my friends, he just always had like nice sketchbooks. And I go, where are you getting that money? Like you're a full-time artist?

01:56:01.410 --> 01:56:28.830
he was like a dirty punk rock guy and he's like you know the skin rags pay just as much it's like they have none of the prestige and like you know i went to the tower records warehouse once where uh they distributed a calendar i made and it's like here's here's like this whole table is the warehouse this is like you know sports illustrated rolling stone this and all of this is porn right so you know you don't want to

01:56:29.506 --> 01:56:58.078
I don't brag about that, but that's just, they're like, they pay literally the same amount as Rolling Stone, but it's not Rolling Stone. So I go, okay, I guess I'm doing that. So then I go to the part of the magazine stand where, you know, there's a curtain and I go back and I start, you know, butthole fever, just start writing down the art director's name. And that was the thing is like, I cared. I cared so much about, it was important to me. It saved me. Art saved me.

01:56:58.690 --> 01:57:22.782
didn't matter if I was doing a logo for Nike or Toyota or like you know I just was like this is you're still looking at me even though if I'm doing a corporate job like I'm I'm in there and I need you to see me and I am even though if I hate the job and you're not even paying me I'm still gonna do my best no matter what like it's I have pride in my work you know and I and I get that from my parents also

01:57:23.298 --> 01:57:50.014
And I love that. I'll go to restaurants where I don't even like the food because I know the waiter is like running to bring me water and he cares. Like anytime, that's the secret ingredient to anything. Anytime I feel like the person cares, it just, it's such a warm feeling, you know? And I cared. And I still do. I care a lot. Like I sit here, I don't give a fuck. I do. I care maybe too much. So I write the number for...

01:57:50.274 --> 01:58:18.718
I try the legit ones first, Penthouse and Playboy, and they're like, nope, nope. I'm like, I guess I go to Hustler and Buttman and Asian Fever. I get a call from Buttman. They're like, these butthole paintings you did, they're just so good. I worked really hard on it. It's not what I want to be doing. They're like, can you come in? It's just...

01:58:19.586 --> 01:58:48.830
to their title. That's all it is. It's just all anal. There's no stories about anal. There's page after page and they go, can you do like this? But like every week I'm like, what do you need? They're like, you know, Superman fucking Lois Lane, anal, Spider-Man fucking, you know, midgets, like whatever, like just all anal. And I go, I can do that. I would love to do that. And like we pay, you know, a couple hundred bucks. I was like,

01:58:49.442 --> 01:59:18.974
And I took it serious. It wasn't like a, it was like, this is my, and a lot of actually famous artists would do that, but under fake names and they didn't want to be associated their real art with that. I was like, and so I did all this art for Buttman. Once again, if you want to cut out any names, I remember everyone's name. It was art director was Heidi. She was so sweet. She's like, it's just like, I was only used to my mom saying she likes my art. So anytime someone not in my family said they liked it, it was,

01:59:19.298 --> 01:59:47.134
oh, it's not just my mom. Like other people like it, you know, but in a, also this massive narcissist, like I'm the best. And like, no, I'm not that good. You know, but like, it's like both, you know? And, um, I don't know why this always kept happening, but all these places I always worked at, they would always go, you got such funny stories. Like, do you got any, you know, and I was like, I think I'd been with one girl. They're like, you have any like butthole stories? And,

01:59:47.842 --> 02:00:16.702
And I had been trained by, you know, Black Belt and Lying, my mom. You know, she's like, yeah, of course. Like, I don't even... It was so easy for me. They're like, oh, because these depictions of anal sex are so graphic and fantastic. And every time you come in, you have some weird story. Like, do you know any women in your life that have experiences like this? And I go, oh, yeah, like super racist against Asians. I go, oh, yeah, like...

02:00:16.834 --> 02:00:42.814
Susie Suzuki, like just making up fake names. They're like, you know someone named Susie Suzuki? I go, oh, yeah, yeah. She goes, do you think she would write about her experiences? And I'm like, how dumb is this lady? Like, I don't fucking know anyone named Susie. Like, what the fuck? And she goes, it's 40 bucks a story. And I'm like, cool. Like, they're paying me 150, 200 bucks for this. So I go home and I would just write the most ridiculous story.

02:00:43.490 --> 02:01:10.910
I don't speak English. You know, this is the voice I hear in my head. I come to America, need a job. And just writing like every like ridiculous male fantasy, like, and then he put in the wrong hole and pornography. I became a pornographer. Like I'm not, it's not like the proudest moment of my life, but I'm like, Oh God, you know, if God's looking down on me, probably, you know, but once again, shame, I'm cool with it. I, I've made,

02:01:11.970 --> 02:01:38.974
I've made myself at home. Like most people, they change their name. But I was like, this is what I do. I'm a fucking, you know. So here we go again, my fucking poor parents, you know. So I'm living at home, right? So I can't hide. I could have done a better job hiding the graffiti. I didn't. They see the spray paint. They see the fucking paint on all my clothes. Was it good? Were you happy with the graffiti? No, I hated it. Okay. I just, I have so much respect for graffiti.

02:01:39.618 --> 02:02:04.094
that like it's it's everything it's physicality you're you're climbing you're you're an it's like fucking navy seal like it's crazy like you need to do a detail of a nose while you're balancing on barbed wire i mean it's yeah those kids are crazy it's insane i'm like fuck dude these people if they had a little bit of guidance they could have been like navy seals green berets whatever um

02:02:04.738 --> 02:02:34.494
So my dad, of course, finds, you know, my parents once again. And then I sit here now as I tell the story and it's coming. Why didn't I hide it better? Oh, like maybe I wanted to get caught, you know? My dad fucking throws. He's like, sexy, sexy. You know, just like once again, it's like this. Like, think about my dad. It's like his friends are like going, you know, his friends' kids are like getting the highest SAT scores. They're getting accepted into Stanford. And they're like, my son is,

02:02:34.978 --> 02:03:04.094
has hair covering his eyes. You know, and I think I was starting to get into like shitty 80s, like Warrant and Winger and Cherry Pot, you know, like that kind of, like, I listen to everything. And just shame. Like literally, like not feeling it, but like having another human, your father tell you, I'm so embarrassed of my son. I'm so embarrassed, like, like anger, tears, like just breaking down

02:03:04.258 --> 02:03:27.710
Like, why did I come to this country? Why did, you know, just like, and I, like, I just, it's like, now I could feel more when I told, but like before I just like, like, I just pretended like it was happening to someone else. You know, I just disassociated. I'm like, whatever, bro. Like, but it wasn't whatever. It was like, my dad disappointed in me. My mom disappointed in me.

02:03:29.538 --> 02:03:53.438
I'm like, fuck, man, it's not really working out for me. Like just rejection after rejection. And I just, I remember the shipping, like it was in the Larry Flint building, Wilshire and La Cienega. And I was like, fuck, I live like a, like I could skate there. Like I'd rather, and I was scared to like send, oh, so this is what happened. So I got busted. The lady,

02:03:53.858 --> 02:04:20.094
I don't know if she was a lesbian or something. She's like, I need to meet Susie Suzuki. It wasn't Suzuki. It was a name like that. It was like Trisha Toyota or something. And I go, Heidi, are you serious right now? It's like, I wrote that story. That story's ridiculous. Like in my head, I'm like, it's so obvious a guy wrote that, you know? And she's like, hey, we might be Buttman Magazine, but we print the truth.

02:04:20.706 --> 02:04:50.494
I was like, what the fuck? You telling me the penthouse letters are real? Like, shut the fuck up. And she's like, she's like, took all my art, threw it at me. It's like, you will never be publishing Buttman anymore. Like, she just, you're done here. And I was like, I spent a long time on those paintings. Like, I, all the folds of the butthole. And like, I, like, I really tried hard. Like, you know, it's like, rejection, reject. Like, I, I had gotten so used to my parents being disappointed in me

02:04:50.754 --> 02:05:18.718
gallery art like it was just it was like cool i don't all right didn't feel i i mean i'm sure it didn't feel good but i had figured out a way to internalize it and just all right and then and then do my mom's delusional thing but but i'm still the best even though the world's telling me like you're you're a loser and i go okay who's the uh art director at hustler wt nelson okay i'm gonna so i call them i go hey i i live

02:05:19.138 --> 02:05:47.902
I can skate there. It'll take me like an hour to get there, but I have these paintings and I don't want to send them in the mail. I never sent paintings in the mail before, and I'd rather save on the shipping. And he's like, I don't know you, dude, and I don't really... But I had already sent the color copies and the pages that they had printed in Buttman, and he's like, but all right, I guess you could come. And I'm like, yes, I'm going to go to the Larry Flint building. This is going to be so cool, you know? And I...

02:05:48.930 --> 02:06:11.006
I go there and he's just like yeah if you just tweak all these paintings you already did we'll use those in Asian Fever we'll use these in you know like different you know there was Hustler had like 20 different other magazines and he's like yeah like that story is awesome we'll print that story and I was like okay cool so I'm like am I am I a writer yeah

02:06:11.106 --> 02:06:40.702
You know, part of me was like, I'm a writer. I'm a published writer. Technically, you're a professional writer at this point. And at the time, I was also writing for Vice. I was writing for Giant Robot, also not getting paid. Like, this was the first time I got paid. So it felt like, oh. Did Buttman pay you? No, they didn't. Because they, we had that fight and they never sent the, you know. Apparently, they quote, only print the truth. But they also don't pay their bills. So the truth only goes so far for them.

02:06:41.186 --> 02:07:06.046
So I, it was me, it was like, I can see a lot of my mom in that now of how the reality is I'm not successful. I'm a pornographer, but in my head, I'm like, I'm published. I'm a real artist. Like, and I'm a writer. I'm a scholar. You know, like I, and then he, I remember WT Nelson paid me and then

02:07:06.882 --> 02:07:36.222
wasn't that much money and like and now it's just like that awkward like yeah we usually don't have the artists come to the it's all like through mail and I don't know you you want some porn this was before Facebook yes yes okay because the reason I ask is uh and I don't want to take you off track because I was wondering when Facebook eventually paid out when the equity popped basically I'll get to all of it and I'm gonna time jump but like it's just uh yeah sure I want to stay I want to stay in the feeling please

02:07:36.834 --> 02:08:06.494
trying to because these are all stories I've told before but like I've never told them from like an emotional perspective it's always just been like almost bragging like I go like I'm trying to for the first time like sit in it and because I want to focus a little bit on the shame part you know and and part of you know part of being an artist is just constant rejection it's like asking a girl out like over and over again it's like you're fat you're ugly no thanks you're not you know it's like

02:08:07.138 --> 02:08:24.958
And for art, it's art is different, you know, like what you think is cool, I might think it's cheesy. And it's like, now I can see that. But before, I was like, you're in the presence of greatness. And you're saying no to me? Like, I'm like, okay, okay. All right, I guess it's not good, you know. So it's what I present and what I feel inside.

02:08:26.530 --> 02:08:52.766
excited to share that Matina, the yerba mate drink I helped create, is now available at Whole Foods stores nationwide. Longtime listeners of this podcast know that yerba mate is my preferred caffeine source. It provides smooth energy without giving you the jitters, and it has a lot of other potential benefits, including helping to regulate your blood sugar, improving digestion, mild appetite suppression, and much more. Matina is my absolute favorite of all the yerba mate brands out there, and I've tried them all.

02:08:52.962 --> 02:09:21.598
Given my love for Matina, I decided to become a part owner in the business and I helped them create their new line of products which are all entirely zero sugar. These zero sugar cold brew Matina flavors are fantastic. I drink at least three cans of them every single day. You'll often see them on the table during my podcast recordings. I absolutely love the product and I'm proud to now have it sold at Whole Foods. So check out Matina at Whole Food stores nationwide. It's cold brewed with the absolute best ingredients. It has zero sugar and it tastes amazing.

02:09:21.762 --> 02:09:50.782
if you don't have a Whole Foods near you, you can also buy it online at drinkmatina.com. So they, I mean, part of it is they just started sending me boxes and porn, porn was expensive. Now these spoiled kids today, it's, you know, you could see anything, right? It's just free internet. But back in the day, if you wanted to buy a video cassette or a DVD or, or a magazine, those things were like $20. Like it was expensive. And now I'm getting these care packages from

02:09:51.074 --> 02:10:19.454
just shit that I'm not even into, like bodybuilder, chicks with, you know, like just, just a lot of shit. And I'm like, it looked crazy at my, at my apartment. Like it was just, I'd finally moved out of the house. I was dating this girl, this crazy actress. And I just, it was Florida. Like every room in the house had some kind of, it was like kind of my identity. They were like Dave, the, you know, and I,

02:10:20.642 --> 02:10:49.886
she was starting to get disgusted. She's like, who am I dating? And I've always, like at the core of all my addictions is codependence. It's, I don't know what's happening. The world is scary. I don't feel safe. And I need to go along to get along. And I need to do, I need to make myself small so that everyone around me feels okay. And at the cost of me, that's what I need. And so, oh, you like that kind of art? Then I'll, I'm a chameleon. I'll switch to that. Oh, you like, oh, you like,

02:10:50.146 --> 02:11:17.598
okay i'll listen to you know and there's like it's not black and white some of it's true and some of it's like a mask and i'm sitting there just just really struggling like stealing fish down my pants so i could eat dinner like i'm not getting paid like there's no money coming in it's like graffiti doesn't pay like the pornography like getting paid in porn is cool but it's not money you know um they're like hey you want and i and i have a

02:11:17.698 --> 02:11:45.854
know i have a sickness i've i have a sex addiction so it's like hey do you want 200 bucks or do you want one thousand dollars in porn which is nothing to them it's just you know so i'm having a i'm just having a hard time and i i get to my 72 plymouth fury who like every time i get in i could kill myself or something you know and there's a note on the door and it says uh doing a period peace movie in los angeles

02:11:46.562 --> 02:12:14.718
car 1970 fits the time uh can we dress it up to make it look like an undercover you know pays something ridiculous like a thousand bucks a day or something i'm like fuck like hell like these small victories you know oh fuck yeah i show up the next day it's on the street everything in the street they made it look like 1970s there's all these other 1972 and they made it they put the the sirens on the top they took the license plate off

02:12:15.394 --> 02:12:40.734
And the guy that's like dressing my car, one of the, you know, the union guys looks in the back and he's like, yo, this guy has so much porn in the back of his car. And I was like, yes, you know, like, and I go, what's this movie? And I see Johnny Depp come out of the house and he's got a blonde hair in a ponytail and it's Blow, that movie Blow with Pee Wee Herman, right? But he wasn't in that scene.

02:12:41.634 --> 02:13:08.318
And I'm like, holy fuck. I love Johnny Depp. I'm like, oh fuck, that's Johnny Depp. And this guy's being really loud. He's like, this guy has a lot of porn. Not just like, and I'm like, oh yeah, I work for Hustler. You work for Hustler? So I remember just, that was the first time I saw like a celebrity on that level in real life. And I was like, oh, he's kind of short. But like, he was like signing autographs and talking to everyone. I'm like, this guy looks,

02:13:09.058 --> 02:13:37.086
he seems very friendly, you know, like he had that whatever charisma, riz, the kids say, and star quality. So then it's, you know, craft, service, lunch, you know, I've never been on a movie set before. I'm just like, I'm getting paid to do nothing and just, and I was like between all the background guys, I was the man because I had so much porn, you know, so I just had, I grabbed a sampling of it. I had some of the,

02:13:37.666 --> 02:14:07.550
some of the ones that I had drawings in and I put some like bookmark, like I, you know, I don't know. It's like maybe Johnny Depp's going to see my butthole paintings and be like, Hey, you paid me, you know, like, I don't know. That's my delusion. Right. So I'm like, is he going to eat in his own trailer or is he going to be down with the crew? And he was down with the crew. So it's like lunch. And it was just a scene like with, I think Ray Liotta and like all this. And I'm just sitting there and I'm like, I want Johnny Depp to see, like, I want to, like, I don't know. And I'm, I'm like,

02:14:08.162 --> 02:14:34.462
who the fuck I have? I'm like 23. I've, you know, I'm like, I do graffiti. Like I got a car that doesn't work for, you know, it's like, but I was like, oh, it's, it's, it's, it's going to happen. So he's sitting down with the crew. He's like telling stories and I didn't have to do it. Another guy was like, Hey Johnny, this guy has all this porn in this guy. He's like, Oh really? You know, I can't do a Johnny Depp impression. And I go, and I was like, my cue. I was like, Hey Johnny, like,

02:14:34.818 --> 02:15:02.046
this is this is my art and and you know i had some butt man in there i had husk i i grabbed the sampling of my you know maybe had some color copies of my my art and and he any and he flips through it he's in his wig and he's like like it's it's a lot of butts you know it's like it's pretty singular uh vision i go yeah i could do other stuff and you know he just hands it back to me i'm like oh fuck and i was like oh thanks johnny you know and i was like

02:15:02.498 --> 02:15:29.406
that was cool and then i'm like trying to spin that in my head of like it immediately goes to he fucking hates you what like what's stupid still like why did you you know like why did you do that and then um i yeah i don't know the movie like you know when they do a hollywood movie they change the name i didn't know it was going to be blow like that movie's awesome and i feel like defeated and they're like hey you know we were going to pay you for two days but we finished the scene so you're only going to get paid for one day and i'm like

02:15:29.922 --> 02:15:56.510
to get as much chicken as possible. So I started getting the Tupperware and I'm like, I'm going to eat for like a week off this craft service food. And I'm walking out and I see all the star wagons and I see on the door, Paul Rubens. I'm like, here we go. Like fucking my childhood. I'm like, and he had gotten cotton jerking off in a movie theater or something. I didn't give it. Like, I always...

02:15:57.058 --> 02:16:24.990
Maybe I can verbalize it better with the shame, but like when Winona Ryder got caught shoplifting or like all of that always made sense to me and it endeared me to, it made me, it made them look human. Like I was like, that's weird. My hero, my childhood hero that did Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Pee Wee's Playhouse, getting caught jerking off. And why did he do that? Why didn't he do it at home? But I, even those things I didn't understand. I was like, now I'm like, I love that guy.

02:16:25.410 --> 02:16:54.879
Like I have nothing but compassion for like... And that's... Like a lot of stuff that I had to work out with myself because a lot of things I do now is I work with, you know, murderers and at-risk youth and children. Like I'll work with anybody because my old self is like, fuck this dude, fuck this person, fuck you, you hurt me, revenge, revenge, very Korean, you know? And now I go...

02:16:56.513 --> 02:17:25.150
And I work with people in prisons. I go, if you're willing to be a better version of yourself, I'm not a scientist, but I can use art and creativity to work with you to be a better person. Or try at least, if you're willing. Only if you're willing. If you're not willing, then I don't want to waste my time. And, you know, great. So, fuck it, I'm going to do it. So, Johnny didn't want the porn here. I don't remember exactly what I wrote. And I was like, biggest fan, love you.

02:17:25.474 --> 02:17:49.438
I think I wrote like, I don't care what they say about you. Like, I'm still love you. And I can draw other stuff, but here's stuff I've done for, and I left it on his thing. I knocked and I was too embarrassed to like, and I ran away. And I mean, it just, there was so many, there was so many moments. I remember,

02:17:51.010 --> 02:18:20.191
And then so it's gradual, right? It's like, okay, and then this little thing happens and this. And it was like, I don't know, a decade before the Facebook. And also, I don't pay attention to that stuff. So as the Facebook stuff was rising, Sean would text me and he's like, hey, you know those shares are worth a quarter million now. But then at the time, I was gambling, and I was making that much gambling. So I was like, whatever, I don't care. And he's like, oh, you know, they're worth a million now. And I had quietly become a millionaire.

02:18:20.897 --> 02:18:47.998
by the time I was 30, I had a huge art show with Steve Lazaridis, who's Banksy's art guy. And I was like, I hit at the right time that shit, you know, like, oh, fuck you, dad. Look, I fucking made, you know, like the art that he hated me for. I was like, look, there it is, you know? And there was always a lot of anger at that. It's like, you fucking live in a house that was paid for by like spray painted dicks, motherfucker. Fuck you. Who, you know, like,

02:18:48.450 --> 02:19:17.982
know and it's like I love my parents it's a love-hate relationship it's complicated or maybe it's not that complicated but it's like um you know hearing I know how proud of even though it's not very Asian for parent from another country to say I'm proud of you like he he tell you know he's like we like kiss on the lips he's like and he rubs my face like I fucking love you dude he doesn't cuss but he's like I love you I'm proud of you and it's like

02:19:18.626 --> 02:19:45.118
all that shit, I just had, it's like, you know, so I have a lot of compassion for, for my, my family. Um, so like, I remember, uh, and then things like, I started working for Vice, you know, I had this relationship with Gavin McInnes and Shane Smith and they just, they're like, Hey, you're,

02:19:45.346 --> 02:20:14.942
You went to Africa to look for a dinosaur. You hitchhike. And this was as print is dying and things are... They were the first early adopters of tech. And they're like, Vice is going to move to online. I'm like, who? I'm always the guy that's like, who the fuck? You know? It's like, I'm like Korean Forrest Gump. I'm like just in the room with like the most important things in life happening. And I go, all right, cool. And they're like, what can you film for nothing? You know, because it was like...

02:20:15.362 --> 02:20:41.950
Spike Jones was there in the beginning, Johnny Knoxville, like, you know, it was like the beginning of that, of Vice, you know, and ended all fucked up because of greed and all that shit. But I was like, every time I hitchhike, something crazy happens. I'm like, okay, cool, film that. So then I started filming Thumbs Up. I think the first, this is what I was saying with time. I think it was 20 years ago. And I do all that shit. And then it's like all the things, like I was saying that,

02:20:42.722 --> 02:21:10.366
was arrested for I got shamed for embarrassed for now people are giving me money and jobs and they're like yeah all that fucked up shit can you do it on camera can you you know and I was like oh they like me my mother was right you know and uh so one day uh uh my friend Dave Chang who also is you know severe gambling issues you know I didn't want to meet that guy because that was like looking in the mirror he was like everyone's like

02:21:10.626 --> 02:21:38.366
you but of cooking and I was like I don't need to meet like I need to meet with people that lift me out of my shit not that's why I hate meeting other addicts because then it's like you know like you never know how it like right now I'm sitting here telling if I'm getting if I'm being if I started this show telling you what I least want to share it's like now I'm addicted to Pokemon right like you go oh you haven't gambled in a casino in 10 years you haven't

02:21:38.530 --> 02:22:06.942
and then you pat yourself on the back. And then the worst thing happens. My kid gets into Pokemon. I go into a shop. I had no idea that packs cost $20. I open a pack, and the worst possible thing could happen. I get the hit card. It's like, you got the Sunbryon, the $1,000. And I'm like, wait, wait, wait, hold on. Wait, what? And I go, oh, this is gambling. And in six months, I've gone from like, maybe I'll spend $100,

02:22:07.074 --> 02:22:27.998
which at the time I was like for fucking cards and now I spend thousands of dollars a day on it and it's and now and I always I always turn my addictions which I'm always open about into my job but it's for work the buttholes that was for work you know everything's for work it's like oh now I'm drawing on the I got one for you I'll give it to you later

02:22:28.098 --> 02:22:55.742
I drew on Mike Tyson for you because I know you like Michael Jones. I should give context. Dave sent me a text yesterday. He said, what's your favorite Pokemon? And I don't know because I don't follow Pokemon. And he goes, what's your favorite athlete? And I said, Mike Tyson. That's a Pikachu painted on top of Mike Tyson for you. This is so dope. So, I mean, it's like. Thank you. You're welcome. You know, the addictions, the things they say about addiction is it's,

02:22:55.874 --> 02:23:24.798
baffling cunning seductive and so you i'm like oh i'm not the gambling comes up in other ways you know it's like trading cards you know like little things and it's like i don't i'm not as a middle-aged man and i'm shaming myself it doesn't feel good to be you know like like i'm friends with guys that are like like money mark who's in the beastie boys like he's 65 and

02:23:25.026 --> 02:23:53.694
My friend, Bill Poon, who I used to do a podcast, he's 62. So like, I'm a middle-aged man hanging out with other middle-aged men in the middle of the night, talking about predator badlands, talking about like childish arrested development type of shit. I go, and the thing is like, I've been to countries and cultures where they're like, even being a Mormon and like when you turn 18, there is a ritual that happens that says, now you're a man.

02:23:54.178 --> 02:24:23.134
We don't have that in our culture. So that's why you have grown men wearing Pokemon t-shirts and talking about fantasy. It's all the same fantasy football. It's all fantasy. It's all immature shit. And you just have grown men collecting toys and comic books and talking about cards. And it's like, okay, if it makes you happy, cool, I guess. But there's always a part of me that's like dissatisfied, like...

02:24:23.394 --> 02:24:46.238
I do like my daily affirmations of like, I don't need to do anything today for Andrew to like me. Like I'm enough. Like I just, I have to sit in that. And I was like, no, I got to. And then I got it from you. You know, it's like, we talked once on the phone before I showed up today and you've sent me a mountain of this Yerba Mate, this delicious Matina. And I'm like,

02:24:46.530 --> 02:25:15.774
I fucking like, this is like crack to me now. And I'm like, oh, this guy, I don't know. Hey, can I get some more of that? And I told you I was starting to get sick. And you're like, oh, I'm going to send you some peptides. And I go, what a sweetie. And cute. And like awesome and very handsome. And like your shirts, the way they fit every time. I'm like, dude, you got some guns and like the clothes look good. I'm jealous of your posture. And I just go, oh, this guy's a caretaker.

02:25:16.354 --> 02:25:43.006
I don't even fucking know the guy and he's sending me like, I don't know if peptides a drug, but he's like, I'll help you, Dave. I'll send you these experimental medicines and this. And I go, thank you. But also you don't need to do any of that. Yeah. Like, I just wanted to meet you. And to be clear, I know I don't have to, it's in my nature to want to care for people that I, I, I feel loved towards. I know, but like we just met and I'm like, those things take time.

02:25:43.234 --> 02:26:12.606
And you're like, no, I got people to do that or whatever. And I go, the cost, I'll speak for myself. The cost of that at some point is you, right? When you spend so much time thinking of others, you know, and so, and it feels like against how I was raised. I go, fuck, this feels selfish for me to, you know, like I never took a, you know, at the height of my workaholism, I was touring with my band. My podcast was DVD, I say was, you know, which I did with Asa Akira, Pornstar and

02:26:13.218 --> 02:26:42.334
Bobby Lee and Steve Lee. It was becoming like the biggest, you know, it was, there was no one doing podcasts back then. It was Joe, um, Adam Carolla. I'm trying to remember. It wasn't that, it wasn't what it is now, you know? And so it was, it was insane. Like, cause I grew up on Howard Stern and I'm like, just hearing him fight, like you couldn't say a certain thing. And, and then he'd get punished by the FCC and then someone, uh,

02:26:42.530 --> 02:27:08.542
like hey Dave you know what a podcast sounds weird what's a podcast and they go and talking about terrestrial radio and the FCC and rules and I was like it's a new canvas you could you can say anything you can fucking say like you could fucking cuss and tell like the worst story like and I I just I couldn't believe that it existed I couldn't believe and so I

02:27:09.218 --> 02:27:37.278
and I didn't like come in with a mission statement and I know intention's huge and part of it was I was just running and running but now in hindsight I go what was that? And I was like oh shame chasing. I was like how can I be as how can I record the downfall of me? Like how much can I go over the edge? How much can I push up against this boundary and see because let me see if you care.

02:27:37.794 --> 02:28:06.366
First of all, I was like, no one's listening. Turns out it was a lot of people listening, but I didn't know that. You know, we started, I was like, let's just go. Let's record our downfall. Let's record our bottom. Like as an addict, like being, like I'm chasing shame. Like in a way, it's like someone who's like a flasher. They're like, what kind of person gets off on like running down the street? I was like, that's what I'm doing. I'm trying to, I'm not, I'm not,

02:28:06.658 --> 02:28:33.534
mentally well person that I'm dealing with demons inside me that I don't know how to articulate. So I'm going to workaholism. I'm going, and I'm trying to find myself and find out what I'm trying. Like I don't, and it's just so painful. And I, I, I feel misunderstood and I go, let's just fucking say the worst possible things every episode and make fun of it like a joke. And just like, I mean, the,

02:28:34.850 --> 02:28:59.646
Once again, if I look back and I go, what's the worst things that ever happened to me? Jail, like getting canceled multiple times. It's like all of it led to the best moments of my life. So I don't sit here and judge, oh, this was good. This was bad because good moments lead to bad. It's just life, right? It's fluid and there's a spectrum of good and bad. So I remember just there was so many things

02:29:02.690 --> 02:29:31.006
I'm like doing this podcast and in my mind I was like, like, and like having Howard Stern write me that going on his show and him telling me afterwards in private, dude, you're out of control was the greatest compliment. You know, Howard Stern, the despise, you know, the king of all media telling me, and I asked him on the show, if you can adopt me. And I'm like, I'm the prince of all media. I fucking do comics and I do fine art. I do graffiti. I can do anything, you know, and to have that validation and,

02:29:31.810 --> 02:30:01.182
you know, we don't talk regularly, but, you know, I started sending him watercolor stuff and then he got into water and he's fucking really good. Like he, like everything, he went into it. And so that was, and then at one point I was talking to his producers about being on, on Sirius, like right after him. And I was like, there's like, Jane Cho was right. I am the greatest, like I can do anything. And then, you know, people started listening and they're like, these people are saying the worst shit ever. And I was like,

02:30:01.378 --> 02:30:30.910
I know, but I'm just like, don't they know I'm a comedian? Like you never told anyone like, and that's not funny, but whatever. I mean, I shouldn't have said like a lot of the things I said and I never gave, I don't like, as an artist, I don't like, like here's my black penis I painted on the wall. Like I don't, I paint and I do stuff, but the mistake that I made was words,

02:30:31.042 --> 02:31:00.670
in the spectrum of entertainment and art everyone watches movies and video games like that's up here so that has the most eyeballs on it then you go all the way down to at the time podcasts art gallery nobody cares you do whatever you want no one cares and so that's how I was approaching it and people go when you paint the most fucking vile obscene disgusting shit it's still a painting right but when you say stuff people take it literally like you're coming at

02:31:00.770 --> 02:31:27.550
microphone like um like it's a oh shit i scared myself um that was so good i love that oh my god that was felt good uh that was a good scream that was like your punk rock someone sampled that turned that into a punk rock song um but i i treated it like it was just another you know i i was it was sean parker i'm not blaming it was

02:31:27.778 --> 02:31:56.190
people in my life that I witnessed as successful, they didn't take reality seriously. Right? I'm like, I don't care what I'm going to say. I'm going to push it as far as I can because I don't care because I don't respect reality. I've never have like, you saw you fucking believe in. Yes. Yes. I believe. Look into my eyes. I believe in Santa Claus. 100%. There's no part of me that doubts that that's who you're talking to. A mentally ill person working on himself,

02:31:56.514 --> 02:32:25.438
express himself as you know like a perfectly imperfect unrepeatable miracle of the universe that's how I I'm trying my best that's it that's it you know so I meet David Chang I become friends with him he's like let's go to dinner I'm gonna bring my friend and his friend happens to be Anthony Bourdain immediately like I've met my my brother like I mean he's older than me but it was just you know ex-heroin addict

02:32:26.114 --> 02:32:55.998
through it through workaholism and I could see that he was tired you know and he had a he had a thing that he kept saying he's like what's your life you just fucking watch tv and watch the simpsons and you know he had this story like I have to live an interesting life and he's like oh I'm doing you know so I I developed a friendship with him because it was just organic like it wasn't like oh I want to

02:32:56.578 --> 02:33:23.934
he was in a way grooming either chang or me or roy choy i don't know he liked asians but he was grooming us to take over basically and um and that that that once again fed my ego of like oh he's he can see what my mom he thinks i'm special like the guy that is the most interesting person on the planet wants me to take over like oh my god this is great you know so he's like my you know it's like

02:33:24.418 --> 02:33:50.462
You know, his show changes names. No reservations. It kept changing. And so, you know, every time I ate with him, it was insane. I mean, I don't know if he had eating disorders or what, but it's Anthony Bourdain. So you go in a restaurant and they bring out every fucking food, right? Like everything. And I go, I'm watching him. He takes a sip of water.

02:33:52.674 --> 02:34:21.470
you can you wrap this up i'm like you're not gonna eat you know because everywhere he went every chef wanted to and he's like dave if i ate all this like i'd be like 300 pounds you know so i'm like can i can i take it home he's like yeah you could have it and then as i got to know him a little better every time he came to l.a to stay at chateau marmont and be like is your life just eating at restaurants and he's like yeah i go hey from now on just come to my house my mom's like he's like i would love that you know he closes it's like

02:34:22.242 --> 02:34:50.462
So whenever he would come to L.A., he would go to my mom's house. My mom loved him. Like Tony and my mom were – I don't know what his relationship with his mom was like, but he loved my mom and he'd always – he knew culture, so he'd always bring the Asian pairs. He knew like, oh, I'm going to a Korean's house. And then after a while, like when I meet people that I love and I respect, I value the friendship. So I don't go –

02:34:51.426 --> 02:35:17.950
doesn't mean i don't value you i was like i would love to be friends with you first before doing your podcast but i was like it like let's just jump into it but do it in reverse yeah we'll do it in reverse and same thing like i never asked to be on a show i never but after a while he just was like dave i'm doing la and i go but haven't you done la he goes yeah but this is specifically koreatown and i go okay i mean i grew up in korea i was born and raised in koreatown but

02:35:18.210 --> 02:35:42.814
So then his producer, his production company, 0.0. I loved it because when I did Thumbs Up, I'm everything. I'm the director. I'm the production. It's just like Thumbs Up is me, my friend Harry, a camera guy, and like a chase van. That's it. It's four people. But, you know, I was like, oh, this is like what a real TV show is like. You had guys setting up shots, and it was like a lot of people. And I go, oh, fuck, this seems cool. Like you don't have to. So.

02:35:44.034 --> 02:36:08.798
So his producer calls me and goes, okay, we're going to set this show up for like two months from now. And it's Koreatown centric. And I go, okay, but do you want to do fake? Like I'm down. Like what do you guys need? Like I know all the restaurants and stuff in Koreatown now, but Koreans don't eat Korean food. Like from my era, we didn't have any money. So...

02:36:09.090 --> 02:36:36.574
we go out we eat at sizzler we eat at denny's we don't eat we get korean food at home you know like so if he's trying to do a authentic story about where i eat in korea it's in korea town it's sizzler and like everyone every korean american i know eats at sizzler and so she's like so you're telling me we're gonna bring anthony bourdain to you know spend all this money to take him to sit i go hey i just told you like i'll fake it like i'll

02:36:36.930 --> 02:37:05.918
know all the new spots i know all the chefs like we couldn't but i didn't eat that shit growing up he goes no tony loves authenticity i'm like we're going to fucking sizzler then so we do this whole episode he comes to my warehouse and he's i mean it's like i mean pitfall after pitfall like it's i remember at the time channing tatum came to my like he's like uh his agent this guy bill korean guy channing tatum's agent's korean and he calls me and he goes

02:37:06.466 --> 02:37:35.486
client Channing Tatum loves you and like it's like after all these things and getting canceled over and over again in comics and whatever field I went in there was always you're not supposed to do that you're not supposed to paint on a Mike Tyson card you're not supposed to paint over this graffiti you're not supposed to there's rules that you're not following and I'm like it was this my whole life so I remember Channing Tatum was also attracted to that and he showed up with with his agent and he's like he had just done he

02:37:35.586 --> 02:38:04.542
a pretty boy he's one of the handsome most handsome guys but he's so talented and I'm like I don't fucking want to meet Channing I don't care about Channing Tatum and then he came to the warehouse and he's like don't think of me as just like the pretty boy dancing step up from the streets guy like I'm about to do G.I. Joe but like I'm like and I'd put out zines and like self-published books and I write the way I talk right now and he'd read that and I was like Channing Tatum read you know he goes

02:38:05.026 --> 02:38:33.726
a great writer and I'm like there it is again I'm like I write porn he's like no no no you have a way of talking and writing that I need to be a part of that like whatever I go but I've never written a script he goes whatever you write I'm gonna produce it and I go holy shit dude this is amazing and then like I don't know I'm time jumping but at some at some point I got a little cocky and he put out uh 21 Jump Street which Johnny Depp again you know and I said uh there's a Ice Cube's talking to

02:38:33.954 --> 02:39:00.638
Korean Jesus during that movie. Do you guys still have that Korean Jesus? He's like, oh yeah, we made that for the, I go, if you guys want to work with me, I need that Korean Jesus. So they sent me the Korean Jesus and I put it in my warehouse and I prayed, I prayed to it every night. I prayed to Korean Jesus. And what else? I mean, because of all the canceling, it's like, if I get canceled at Marvel, then DC wants to work with me. So it's like,

02:39:00.866 --> 02:39:30.750
again being rewarded rewarded for the bad behavior so there's this editor at DC Comics oh cool I can't draw Hulk and Wolverine but Batman Superman and he this guy Axel Alonso who worked at Vertigo which was like the more adult like Sandman and stuff like that he contacts me and he's like I've been reading your fucking fucked up articles and vice he's like you're a writer that's the thing that I have the most respect for is writing like I have a book in me I've never I haven't sat down but it's like it's in here

02:39:31.746 --> 02:40:01.726
too scared to get it out. But he's like, he's like, yeah, your art's okay. I go, okay. And he goes, I want you to write a book about, you know, it was like Koreatown gangsters or something. It was shit that I didn't know about. I was like, fuck it. I'll make it up. And I was like, yeah, I'm going to write it like this. And he's like, no, you're going to write it and someone else is going to draw it. I was like, oh, okay. But he was like, and then I started writing it and I start writing him emails like it's done. And

02:40:02.370 --> 02:40:31.166
bounced back. He quit and moved to Marvel. And I'm like, oh, fuck, it was almost about to happen. And then my podcast starts getting bigger and bigger. So I'm in my full workaholism. I'm aware that I'm an addict. I'm in my full addiction. I'm gambling with my life and life savings every single day while I'm

02:40:31.458 --> 02:40:59.838
with my band, Mangchi, doing the news for Vice, doing art shows, like, legally around the world and doing illegal, like, just, and people are like, are you on coke? I'm like, I don't have chemical, I don't do, I get high off, like, I, and each thing is like, I have to do the, I, I'm not enough. That's what I believe about, that's what I did believe about myself and still sometimes it is. I was, everything the world had shown me

02:41:00.034 --> 02:41:29.438
is that besides from my mother is that you're not, and that was also confusing because she sent me away and abandoned me. So it was like, you're telling me I'm the best, but then you threw me out like trash. So a lot of mixed messages and the messaging that I heard growing up that I received was you're not enough. Women don't date Asians. Your art looks like shit. You're not following the graffiti rules.

02:41:29.922 --> 02:41:57.822
art's a little too aggressive to be refined for it's just everything is just so everything had to be I need to be it's not it's not like I can kind of be in this field like I have to have the best podcast and in my mind that was Howard Stern so I was like however extreme he is I have to go like Howard's the ringleader but I need to be the guy that's the you know and I don't care what happens to me because I've had third degrees burns all over my foot like my brother's read my diary and

02:41:58.018 --> 02:42:26.846
been stabbed in my, like, I don't care what you do to me because it'll never be what I can do to myself. I've hurt myself. So, so then, uh, I'm in Russia or the North pole interviewing. It's my first time doing the serious news. And I remember at the time, Shane and Eddie and everyone at Vice, we sat down and they're like, Dave, your podcast is out of control. It was like, and they, and like, they all know me. They're like, you can't say those things. I go,

02:42:27.042 --> 02:42:52.094
what the fuck i want i'm like this is vice baby like we did they're like dave and and it was like second season of vice news on hbo the first season was dennis rodman in north korea getting a lot of attention we start getting emmy nominations and the year that we did it i won the emmy for the news i'm like for you know my ego's like oh the first time doing the news fucking nailed it and i'm like i'm god dude

02:42:52.354 --> 02:43:20.062
do serious news and i could do weird butthole talk on this show and i could do serious fucking delicate watercolors that could be in a museum and i could do the most craziest like you can't fucking put me in a box and if you try to i'm like i am better than you i'm better than you as a human being i'm better than you as an art and it was like my friends just like because it's easier when you're an alcoholic or drug addict you're like bro you're unhinged you're out of control but it was just

02:43:21.826 --> 02:43:48.190
narcissism, hating myself, self-destructive behavior, just, and the people would come up to come with me. I'd bring them to, cause I controlled my addiction. Like I would, I knew that I had a problem and I know the nature of addiction is you can't stop. So I did something that I've never heard another addict do, which is I would hire people, close friends being like, I'm an addict. I cannot be trusted. I'm a liar. I'm a thief.

02:43:48.546 --> 02:44:15.774
So when I'm in my gambling state, I don't hold my money. So as soon as I win the number I told you I'm win, I need you to punch me in the face. I need you to drag me away from the table because now I'm going to say anything to keep going. So I can never touch my own money. If you see me falling in love with a girl and going into my love addiction, I need you to come and punch me in my face. And like I gave permission for people to hurt me physically and to physically remove me.

02:44:16.290 --> 02:44:40.862
Like if I was an alcoholic, it would be I'm at a bar and after two drinks, if you see me take a third, boom, and drag me out of the bar. So in that way, very sadomasochistic, but successful. Like I never, because I had someone and they would only get paid if they got me to stop, right? But then I would pay these people to stop me and then try to figure out ways to, you know,

02:44:41.858 --> 02:45:08.254
at the height of my workaholism is the height of my addiction. Like I got every, I don't sleep. There's days. And then I had a heart attack when I was 35, an angina attack. I collapsed. I went blind. I collapsed. And of course, like a lot of stories, as soon as I didn't go to the hospital, as soon as I woke up, I was like, what the fuck was that? Like I woke up 30 hours later, another day, and I just went back to gambling. But it was like,

02:45:09.218 --> 02:45:36.734
I could go into euphoric recall and just start telling like, but I don't want to like glamor because it's like, I figured out how to be in the world. If I have sex with lots of women and win lots of money and work really hard at all these jobs, then I will be validated and congratulated and held up high in this culture, even though if I'm dying inside. I've spent so much time in shame

02:45:36.994 --> 02:45:59.902
I want to see what it feels like to be a winner. But then when I got there, I go, what do you do when you get to the... Heavy is the crown. It's lonely. I got to the top and I was like, kind of boring. The kid in the village with the match, let's burn it down. We got here. And that was my childhood, literally. I would spend a lot of time building giant Legos,

02:46:00.002 --> 02:46:28.894
all the loot like we had like all mismatched legos that was like you know hand-me-downs and i would build a giant starship and my brother would come in cool and just smash it i was like i worked so long on that but that was me doing my brother is somewhere around about to destroy my career let me just do it myself let me self-sabotage myself self-sabotage it was like mini suicides you know and so it's all i'm like here here i am it's all

02:46:29.314 --> 02:46:57.726
I'm finally going to be, you know, validated as a human being, you know? And then I get, you know, I get Vice telling me, hey, you can't do your podcast and the news. And I go, then go fuck yourself, you know? And then we win the Emmy, but I'm not part of that anymore. And then I can't keep track because I keep, they're like, did you know this artist got caught on saying, I go, it's on my podcast. It was my podcast. You don't fucking, it's not like I did it on purpose.

02:46:58.114 --> 02:47:25.982
you know anyways it just kept happening and I I'm at the sickest I've been mentally and I'm trying to make sense of my situation while the world is also has its own issues and I and I I just I like I hit my bottom I just went so off the deep end and my friends were all like you're gonna die like it's not like a normal OD with drugs but

02:47:26.466 --> 02:47:55.390
You like literally had a heart attack from like not sleeping and gambling for like a week straight. Like masturbating nonstop to pornography. Just like video games. Like I couldn't stop playing Angry Birds, which like everything's like so I can make a joke out of it. And they're like, that's your safety thing is to like make a joke out of it. And so I walk in to, you know, a meeting and Channing Tatum's dude is like,

02:47:55.938 --> 02:48:25.886
Henning ain't fucking working with you. And it wasn't him. It was like, hey, I've spent all, it was the agency. It was like, we've spent all this time building up a heartthrob teen idol thing. He's not going to be fucking seen with a scumbag like you. I go, oh shit, it's happening again. Shame. I walk into 0.0. Bourdain's like, when I'm done, it's you. You're going to, here's a book deal with my publishing company. Your show is going to be on CNN. It's going to be exactly like mine, but with art.

02:48:26.242 --> 02:48:55.710
you're going to travel around the art and it's like authentic to you because you already do that. I'm just like, holy shit, dude. This is, it paid off. All the bad behavior, like I met my kindred spirit and, and I knew he wasn't happy. That's one of my, I can't watch, like it's been years since, since all that happened and I still, I can't, I can't, like I felt,

02:48:55.938 --> 02:49:25.758
felt like I met someone who finally understood me. So I know it wasn't him, but, you know, I don't remember the guy's name. I remember them and they could have told me over the phone. They're like, Dave, it was like getting caught at the principal's office. It was like, and I'm pumped. I'm like, my mom was right. Jane Jo was right. Like the most interesting man on the planet, like my friend, Tony,

02:49:26.146 --> 02:49:52.638
is like handing me the baton. Like, and I'm gonna do, like, I'm gonna go for it. Like, I wasn't married, I didn't have kids. I'm like, I'm gonna fucking really, really, like, I took it so seriously. Went to Nat Geo, like, took all the meetings. And, you know, I remember sitting at a table just like this and the whole 0.0 production team is like, we love Tony. Like, he goes, but we are not working with you.

02:49:53.186 --> 02:50:22.206
I go, you couldn't fucking send an email? Like, what are you, shaming? And all of this is fuel for me. Like, they don't know this. I'm like, the more you fucking do this to me, the more you're giving me my drug, which I'm chasing, which is anger and shame. It's a fucking powerful drug, right? And I go, okay, just another on the list that I got to prove wrong. Like, I will make you regret the same way Chip regrets fucking talking shit. Like, I will make you feel...

02:50:22.722 --> 02:50:51.230
come at me you better fucking kill me because I'm going to fucking destroy you now like I am going to make the most awesome show ever and you know Tony called me in a policy like dude I don't like they're their own company like we work together but they you know they the optics aren't good and I go all right you know and I was like missed it by that much like so it and and I had grown accustomed to it

02:50:51.522 --> 02:51:19.102
This was, it's not a new, it's, if I could just keep telling another, like, oh, and then Marvel rejected me, then DC, then... The episode I did with Tony, I take him to Sizzler. I show him how I fucking did a fusion with a meatball and a taco. It was true to me, right? You know, I hammed it up a little bit for the camera. I wore my, like, shiny red Sizzler suit, but that was me. That was how my family...

02:51:19.234 --> 02:51:44.702
It resonated. It was the most watched episode. I introduced him to Estevan Oriol and Mr. Cartoon. He loved all the lowrider cars. It was a fucking LA episode and it was like my friends and it was like, it was awesome. I felt so good and I just started getting, like Sizzler asked me to be their spokesperson. The episode is me talking shit about how horrible their food is, but it has this, I'll do it guys. I'll do it. And so,

02:51:45.186 --> 02:52:11.358
They're like, it's the most watched episode of that. And then we won an Emmy for that season. And I'm just like, and then that happens. And I'm like, holy shit. And then you go on Netflix or whatever it was on. And that episode is just missing. I mean, it's back now, but they took it off. And I was like, just keep striking. And I'm like, what did I do? Like me playing Vic. What did I do? Did I do that? Like I'm Urkel. I'm like...

02:52:11.938 --> 02:52:39.998
you're a fucking idiot, dude. You do dumb shit that you shouldn't do. You should shut the fuck up and just... And... When I meet the most powerful intellectually, like just these powerhouse humans, once again, it doesn't always have to be sexual abuse, but it usually is with men, right? I mean, women, I don't know that experience because I'm not a woman, but for a man to take your humanity like that, then I see...

02:52:40.450 --> 02:53:07.582
It's PTSD. It's right. Post-traumatic stress disorder. But then every now and then, like, I don't know what the exact stats are. You get PT. I'm making this up. PTGD, post-traumatic growth disorder. It's like that should have turned me into a drug addict, homeless person. But instead, I took all that pain and I was like, K-rage, I'll show you. I'll fucking show you. You should have never done that to me.

02:53:11.778 --> 02:53:33.630
You should have never, you should have never minimized me and put me down and disregarded me. And now I have to teach you a lesson. Now I have to show you who you're fucking with. And it's such a horrible,

02:53:49.506 --> 02:54:17.886
such a painful way to live life and I can't live with that pain so I have to just keep doing more it's never enough I have to just keep showing you that I'm enough so then I'm just I'm living in like a very

02:54:18.146 --> 02:54:46.206
know I'm telling a very name droppy like douchey LA story but you know I have Anthony Bourdain who's I consider a friend and my hero and my idol like I was in a gang called Koreans got bad that was two people me and my friend Harry Kim but we wrote it everywhere KGB everywhere and then I remember the episode came out and he wrote KGB forever or something like that Koreans got I'm like fucking my gang is

02:54:46.370 --> 02:55:14.142
Kim and Anthony Bourdain like I just I was like it just it made me so happy that it's like Tony Bourdain is repping my set you know like like I'm a fucking game you know it's like it was two fucking dumb asses just writing drawing dumb bucktooth whales and I mean I miss that guy so much the people that were close to him like you and Joe yeah so it's the same response

02:55:14.626 --> 02:55:44.574
So then I'm, you know, I'm like lost. I'm getting closer and closer to hitting my version of a bottom. And I get a call from David Arquette, like the actor, you know. And I love all the Arquettes, you know, but David, you know, this is LA shit, right? He just reaches out and he's like, hey, I'm watching TV right now with my, I think, fiance at the time.

02:55:44.706 --> 02:56:14.398
And we just saw your Anthony Bort. And he's like, that's the most fucking L.A. shit. He's like, I wrote, I was in a crew called KGB. Kid's gone bad. And I was like, no, Kareem's gone bad, you know. And he goes, it's crazy. Like, I used to do graffiti and tag. I used to write KGB. And I grew up eating at Sizzler with my family. And he goes, and I'm turning, I forgot. He was like, I'm turning 45 or 50. I forgot how old he was. But it was like a big one, like 40 years.

02:56:14.690 --> 02:56:42.686
And I'm having it at like, you know, Sizzler's almost out of business. I think there's like three left in LA. And he's like, and it's at the Sizzler that I grew up and I would love for you to be here. And all that stuff always, all like weird celebrity stuff always makes me nervous because I'm like, I don't know if they're going to be fake or, you know, and I'm a sensitive person. Like if I'm meeting new people and they don't like me, I'm like, oh, I'm a piece of, you know, I'm sensitive. I'm a sensitive artist. Yeah.

02:56:43.682 --> 02:57:12.638
So I go to Sizzler with my friend Critter. I was like, hey, can you come with me? And we get to Sizzler and it's packed and it's there's the buffet bar with the cheese toast. And he's like, Dave, Dave, I want I want you to meet some friends here. Come sit at this table. And I sit down and it's Sacha Baron Cohen, like my fucking hero and Pee Wee Herman. And I'm like, holy fuck, dude. And, you know, both of them are just huge art fans. So like they don't know my art, but

02:57:12.770 --> 02:57:42.590
David Arquette talking. He's like, this guy's an awesome artist. And they're like, oh, cool. We want to check it out. So, you know, Sacha Baron Cohen collects a lot of Banksy and this. And he's like, fuck, dude. I got to come to your studio. So then I'm like, oh, cool. Once again, like this, oh, people like me. And if people like me, then maybe I like myself. And it's nice to be liked. It feels good to be validated and liked by people that you look up to.

02:57:42.914 --> 02:58:09.406
So especially Pee Wee Herman's my art god. Like I said, Bob Ross, Mr. Rogers, dope. But for me, that's what I grew up on. That fucking character, the full commitment to that character, the voice, the king of cartoon, Penny, the stop motion animation. I just, it spoke to me, you know? All the Gary Panter art. So, yeah.

02:58:10.466 --> 02:58:39.070
fuck I don't know when I'm gonna meet this guy again I go hey uh I don't know 20 years ago 15 years ago you did a movie called blow and he's like oh yeah blow you know I go hey uh did you ever remember like getting a porn package on your step and he's like and like I'm trying to read his eyes he's like no I don't remember that I was like ah I guess someone you know but I did get his number that night and then um you know as I get

02:58:39.842 --> 02:59:05.214
hit like like I wouldn't be here today without my friends just all who love me came and they're like Dave you're not like it it went too far this way you know you used to be this sweet nice humble guy and just you just you need a lot of help so I like everything else I just dedicate I thought I obviously it was the hardest thing I ever did in my life but including plant medicine therapy rehabs

02:59:05.410 --> 02:59:34.270
Friends groups, 12-step meetings, just whatever. If someone said it was going to help you, I'm like, you're just breaking like generations of, oh, fucking Asians hit their kids. You know, everyone got sent away. You know, just like, I know, but I want it to stop. It's either I fucking kill myself or I need it to stop. And enough people caring about me made me care about myself enough to,

02:59:35.426 --> 03:00:05.086
And I did, the podcast, the band, like the people, and they go, they'll be fine. Everyone's going to figure it out. And I got help. And, you know, as soon as I was out of the first rehab, like 45 days, I was like, I'm going to do a podcast about this. And they're like, Matt out there, he's just like, hey, why don't you live this life before you start telling it? And he's like, but I learned so many. And he go, yeah, but why don't you implement it in your life? And so I'm 49 now.

03:00:06.722 --> 03:00:33.150
I rarely do podcasts. I'd still do something creative every single day. I like to do it with other people. I'd like to thank the sponsor today for this, God. I know people are like, oh, all you're religious. I go, I don't believe in God, but I still pray to him. And God, whatever you want to call it, whatever that is, whatever that thing is,

03:00:33.474 --> 03:00:58.206
controls telepathy and santa and connection and all this he doesn't care if i believe in him he's still there right it's like such an ego thing of that i don't who cares what you the thing it's like saying you don't believe in the ocean the ocean is still there so i want to thank that guy and um and so as i live this life and then i start to be like what is my purpose why am i here what is you know

03:00:58.434 --> 03:01:28.414
your art was about like disgustingness and offending people and it was just a fuck you just showing people hey Asian people aren't all quiet like you're a rebel like show like you're supposed to shut the fuck up and become a lawyer or doctor and then just like I always tell people they go oh how do I make it I want to be I go I'm an expert in disappointing my parents you must disappoint your parents like my dad is so disappointed in me over and over again I'm

03:01:28.738 --> 03:01:54.078
he's not but I'm like what would have happened if I didn't disappoint him I would have got a pretty high SAT I would have you know probably been on my second marriage lawyer golf like and he'd be like ah I don't know I don't know but I I know that he's proud of me now and it was like a long hard path to get there and so um I go I and part of me

03:01:54.818 --> 03:02:23.230
if you can't tell by now, it goes like this. The pendulum swings very hard. So I said to myself, I'm going to, like everything up until now has been about, look at me, let me show you. And it's like, and I go, it's, I got to take some space for me now. And, and, and, you know, I work with all these youth groups and stuff and people go, Hey, you know, you did a lot of media and you did a lot of shit where you put yourself out there showing the worst part of yourself and

03:02:23.458 --> 03:02:52.094
and like trying to prove to people that you're not a good person is like, you know, it would like touch people and help people to see like your journey and your path. And I go, fuck that. I'm not going to put myself through that. Like I'm taking space. And they're like, yeah, but like at some point, are you going to share your story? And I go, no, that's too literal. I hate words. Words can be confused. Words can be misconstrued. I'm not doing that. I'm just doing this and this is enough. Like your ego goes, oh, I'm working with 12 kids today.

03:02:52.834 --> 03:03:18.622
But if it was filmed, it could reach millions of people. And it's like, no, you're working with 12 kids today and that's it. And that's enough. Right. But then at some point after years, this is years, a decade of recovery. I thought, well, part of the reason why I hate working with not like Netflix, Hulu, HBO, it doesn't matter. Like they're all corporations. They could be cool or whatever. But.

03:03:19.938 --> 03:03:49.886
And even podcasts, which was, that's the conversation we had. I'm like, it all gets edited. It's like as soon as anything gets a little... And so I go, I'll just make my own show because I have money to do that and it's not going to cost that much. And then if someone wants to buy it, they will or they won't. So I started making my version of Pee Wee's Playhouse, which was the Chow Show. And it came out on FX, on Hulu. And I got to learn what taking notes and having...

03:03:50.274 --> 03:04:18.430
corporate feedback and whatever. I'm grateful that it happened, but they killed a lot of the episodes and everyone's like, who's your dream guest? And I was like, it doesn't matter. I'll talk to anybody. I'll talk to like the garbage man. I'll talk, you know, but they're like, it's for TV. So you should try to get some celebrities or well-known people. And I was like, I want Pee Wee Herman, you know? And I had his number still from Sizzler. So I called him and I, you know, and Pee Wee Herman's like,

03:04:20.194 --> 03:04:44.446
know if he's just one of those people that once he gets your contact info you get a birthday message from him every year or a christmas card i was like it just every time i got it i would send show all my friends i'm like it just made me feel so good um so yeah i have those emails that sean parker said about like what he wanted from my art to disrupt the world i have the nice message from howard stern and

03:04:44.994 --> 03:05:14.142
have the voice. So I called Pee Wee and he's like, Dave, I got some stuff, some health stuff going on. And he's like, I feel honored. Thank you. Like, you know, I love your art. You know, now he got to learn a little bit about me. And he's like, and I would love to be on your show, but I just, I don't know. I don't want to be on camera anymore. And he's like, you could send the episodes and I'll give you some, like, if you open to it. I was like, of course, you know. And it was just, it just,

03:05:15.330 --> 03:05:43.038
I couldn't believe that I was talking to him and he like was talking back to me as a equal and then I mean but I got it right away he's not gonna do it you know and then at the end right before I hung up he goes you paint butts really good oh man he got it he got it and I you know he's like

03:05:44.802 --> 03:06:12.670
I'm old. I don't want to talk on the microphone. So I don't know if that answered your question about the South Bay. I know that was a long answer for the one question you asked me, but I don't know. Like when people, like, I feel like you're an open person. So if you ask me something, I'm like, and you're ready to go into my head space and,

03:06:13.346 --> 03:06:41.310
we can go there together, then I feel like cared for, listened to. And like, I'm like, cause you know, you listen and they're not present. They're looking at their phone. They're like, okay, this show is two hours. And I'm like, I got law, you know, and that's also how I write very long run on sentences, no punctuation. So there's no like creativity is such a hard thing to have a conversation about because it's not,

03:06:41.986 --> 03:07:11.102
Like, my path is not someone else's path. And today, it's just every day I wake up with what I didn't have before, which is gratitude. I just wake up, and it's like... I had a horrible day today. Like, it was not good. Like, the fucking, like, flat tire. Appointment canceled. Moved back. Fucking crazy family shit happening with my dad. And I was just like...

03:07:11.394 --> 03:07:40.574
wasn't going to cancel but the feeling was like it's not this not the right headspace to go and then I said you know what every like I could sit there and like self uh analyze oh you have depression you have this and it's like almost some weird OCD like and you're a horrible person and you and you you have antisocial traits and they go okay and then what are you going to do about it you know and so I I sit back now

03:07:41.890 --> 03:08:10.590
if I examine my life like a scientist, I go, hey, what was all that shit about on your podcast? Why did you say that stuff on your podcast? Why did you do that thing that's against your value system? Why did you... What was about the fucking... Like all the suicidal ideation, all the times you try to... Like what was that about, you know? And not just...

03:08:11.330 --> 03:08:41.118
I said, like logically, I know if I sound hypocritical, not just trying to like analyze it, like, but just an examination of my own heart, like doing an x-ray of my heart. It's like, what were you feeling then? And what, like, what is the shame hitting? And why did you do that? And like, so I sit there and I go, we live in a society, I'll use I statements. I live in the way the culture I was grown was, when someone asks you how you're doing, it's just good.

03:08:41.506 --> 03:09:09.726
which aren't emotions. That's all you say. You don't go, oh, let me tell you, like, I'm feeling shame today. And, you know, so we live, I live in, I lived, I was raised in a culture of everything's fine. Everything's okay. Get along to go along. You know, I was a lot of like Asian, the only Asian family in like a white neighborhood or black neighborhoods was like, don't, it's a lot of immigrant story, right? Like don't rock the boat. Don't do anything to stand out.

03:09:10.242 --> 03:09:36.446
guests in this country we're lucky to be here don't do basically everything I did you know like you know keep clear up the campground leave it nice and so I sit here and if I'm being introspective this is all this stuff is like this is why I say this would be intimate because it's just private stuff that I don't like I'm trying to just you know know my own heart

03:09:39.266 --> 03:10:07.902
it's like what why what is the insane opening Pokemon packs about like right you could turn that into a joke or like what is what is the unmet need like what is your depression telling you right now what is your anger if your anger is like unmatched with like oh there was like a little flare up at school some kid said something to your kid and then like your response is like yeah like what's that about so instead of

03:10:08.098 --> 03:10:36.702
shaming myself and going, I'm a piece of shit. Oh, I did all this work and I'm still this much. It's just... And I think if I can get quiet and right-sized in that moment instead of, oh, I need to, like, make a story in my head to be, like, and just sit in that ugliness and uncomfortable, like, if I can do that, I couldn't do that before. I can't... Like, you have to either look at me like I'm nothing or I'm the greatest. I can't just...

03:10:37.250 --> 03:11:05.278
Dave's kind of boring today or he's kind of not making sense or he feels like I couldn't, it had to be all or nothing. It was very black and white, very Christian the way I was raised, OCD, like God's way or Satan's way. And so now I just go, that's Palo Alto. If I could find the Palo Alto in my heart, just like the mundane, culturally, like if I could sit in the boring, mundane space and I dare to be

03:11:05.890 --> 03:11:34.846
or dare to be moderate and just like I said, the feeling is like, oh, what's the sensations? Then that's where the brilliance is. Then I could find my inner spark. I could find, and then in that is when I feel the closest to you and other, like if I'm with another person who's close, this is like just like banging my head against the wall. But if I can meet another spirit or soul

03:11:35.394 --> 03:12:05.086
And you're, it doesn't have, I don't have to agree with you, but it's like you're, I don't, like, I've been talking my ass off. I understand that. Like, we could go all night, right? And if you share with me your heart, then it's a shared brokenness. You don't get to where, Andrew Huberman doesn't get to this with a smooth, like, shit went down. I don't know, but it's on your face. And it's like a vibrational thing, right? Like, you don't,

03:12:06.114 --> 03:12:33.758
don't fucking tattoo your whole body if everything was cool, right? You don't just become as smart as you are without, like, if you want to destroy me intellectually, you can. Like, I wouldn't, I would be like, like, right? So if I can sit in and be vulnerable and say, like, hey, I'm not perfect, but I'm not a piece of shit. I'm enough. Like, I don't need to do anything today. And that's, for me, that was like, like these cultural moments of,

03:12:34.434 --> 03:13:03.966
watching outcast be inducted into the hall of fame and andre 3000 going i'm not gonna rap but everyone wants you to that's not where i'm at right now i'm just gonna i was like fucking amazing you know or uh tarantino's saying paul dano this is like the worst part of there will be blood i was like wow that's the best thing that ever happened you had saw like everyone come out to say how brilliant he is i mean what if tarantino just said paul dano's amazing then that would just so i just i just find these

03:13:04.994 --> 03:13:34.238
what is um without trying to like psychoanalyze or overanalyze every moment of my life just go the space right because i've done the brain mapping and they're like the way it was explained to me they dumbed it down they're like you're not a psychopath because you do you do psychopathic things but you actually care about people you're not a psychopath and they say the the space in your brain there's like a bridge like here's

03:13:34.818 --> 03:14:02.782
You know, it's like, it's like, should I jump off this cliff? And like most people will executive function like, oh, okay, maybe I'm going to get hurt. And like that, that bridge is smaller for people like you. They saw like a little, they go, so you don't really think you just do. And then that's how you, you're like, how did I end up in jail? How did I fucking like, and, and, and that makes for a great story. That makes for a great fucking life or like a storybook, crazy life that makes for,

03:14:03.170 --> 03:14:30.814
And that's a story that's just told, like, you need to be a fucking psychotic, insane, crazy person to be the greatest artist, right? If you're just like a, you know, boring person living at home with like air conditioning and wifi and your warm cup of Earl Grey, and you could do good art. You could even do great art, but you won't ever be the best because you're not facing your shadow. You're not looking at yourself. You're just, that's just technique. That's just craft. That's just skill. Like,

03:14:31.234 --> 03:15:00.926
ripping my fucking heart out and showing it to you. I'm like, what do you think? I'm not saying, what do you think? I'm like, fucking, what do you think? You know? No, I feel it. I mean, I feel it. Okay. You know, I mean, I, I, um. Sorry, there's like spit all over the table. Please don't apologize. Don't apologize. I know. Please don't. I'm slobbering right into your microphone. No apology. Ah! You guys almost got me there. No apology. Um, I feel it. I mean, I, I, um,

03:15:01.762 --> 03:15:29.662
And everybody feels it. And if they don't, they should take a look inside. Like we're... It's going to sound like I'm name dropping now. Go ahead. Go for it. I feel very blessed to have Rick Rubin as my close friend. Not because he's Rick Rubin who produced all this music. That's super cool too. But because he has antennae and he can feel shit. Yeah.

03:15:29.826 --> 03:15:55.838
And he can feel it, but he doesn't get absorbed in it. It's very interesting. I don't have that. Yeah. I feel stuff and it just... Yeah. And I am certain people feel your heart in what you do. The self-sacrifice part is hard to hear about. I can relate. Well, I...

03:15:57.090 --> 03:16:25.566
to Rob a little bit because he's like a PR dude before. Was a PR. He's like a producer. I mean, he's out of it. That smile hides a lot of pain right there. Look at that smile. But yeah, I... Yeah, it's hard. Like, you know, they say all these dumb quotes. Like, no is a complete sentence. And it is, right? I go no and then I have to make up some fake. Like, oh, but like I got... You know, my car...

03:16:25.730 --> 03:16:52.254
get a flat tire but that was a that used to be a thing I would make up and then people would be like let me see the metadata metadata on your phone and make sure that's not a screenshot from like two years you know like um so I would lie and and make up excuses but the the ability to it goes against how I was raised it goes against my culture to just say no to my parents no to

03:16:53.570 --> 03:17:20.798
No to think like leaving money on the table saying so that I could put myself first for the first time and and nurture my own heart and take care of myself is like it just sounded like that's I'd already written my story I'm like you know and then when you have heroes like Bourdain like I think a lot of people also killed themselves after Bourdain did that because they're like if the most interesting man on the planet the guy that's

03:17:21.442 --> 03:17:48.030
role model a guy i look up to like he's not he can't fucking figure it out then fuck what's there and and then almost validates it like it's so you can do it too like anyone like uh so i it was just it just i had it written out like everyone i look to look up to and it's so fucking boring and cliche when i think about it makes me so angry it's like

03:17:49.378 --> 03:18:18.206
live fast, die young, and then just have people say nice shit about you. And it's like, or just be a little bit more boring and have wonderful relationships. Like I, you call me and you go, you're probably busy. I'm like, I'm not that busy, dude. I'm not a busy person. I make a lot of space for myself now. I don't like, and I deserve it. Like I owe that to myself. I was about to say you've earned it, but you never needed to earn it.

03:18:18.786 --> 03:18:48.766
know. Yeah. I'm glad to hear it because, um, will you commit to taking a year off? I could use some time off. All right. So that sounds like I'll start the negotiations at a year. And then if I can get you anywhere close to that, because people will be like, oh shit, you know, like the American vacation is like a week or two weeks, right? That's nothing. That's like barely enough time to. Yeah. I have all these war stories. I don't want to make this about me, but I have all these war stories. Like, you know, my girlfriend at the time, she'll validate these as, you know, being, you

03:18:48.866 --> 03:19:17.982
know, diarrhea and vomiting while writing a grant back when. And, you know, I mean, if I, I've had so many wonderful opportunities, but I've been going pretty hard into the paint since I was 19. Like that means nonstop. That means like 50 to a hundred hour weeks since then. Like what's the longest vacation you've ever taken in your life? Four days. I mean, this isn't me deflecting. It's just like, I just met you and like, I'm so happy that like,

03:19:18.786 --> 03:19:46.430
I was like, if I can, if he gives me the space to speak, which you did, and you can feel what I, like what I was trying to say. And like, to me, like, that's all I want is connection, right? Like that's, I want to be seen now before I was hiding and wearing masks. But in that I felt you and I go, I didn't know what you were going to say, but I was like, it's going to be less than a week because you don't get, cause I know you don't get to where nobody does.

03:19:47.298 --> 03:20:16.126
Everyone pays the price. You don't get to where you are right now by taking time off. You just don't. But like you just said to me, I'll say it back to you. You deserve it. And to speak to the workaholic part of you, and I say this to people that are like you and me, you will have more ideas, more inspiration. You can't think now because you're thinking about how's Rob going to get paid?

03:20:16.226 --> 03:20:45.150
take care of a lot of people right but in that time i could come i could get rid of all this black i could make add some color here i could get you some white t-shirts you could spend time with your family just the shit that you're running from you know and i feel like okay a year is unrealistic you're like i'm running you know but it's it will like people oh go do plant medicine i was like just taking a year off and first weeks or months will just be you unlearning the

03:20:45.314 --> 03:21:13.982
of just, I got to do something to have value and just, and I feel like it will, when you come back, you'll be like, like a thousand, you know, like, and sometimes in our culture, we get knocked down, not by our choice. And then, but I'm like, this would be by your choice. You know, I, I taking care of Andy today. Love you, Rob. Love you, all you guys out there, but

03:21:14.978 --> 03:21:42.142
You know what? I'll run your podcast while you're gone. That would be sick. I'll do all the science. You could feed me some big words to use. And I'll go paint. Oh, my God. I'm going to – yeah, I feel more comfortable with you now. It's like I think I would lie to you. Like whatever you showed me, I would be like, oh, that's cool. But like I think it's cool that anyone who's an egghead who spends time up here, I think every –

03:21:43.266 --> 03:22:10.654
thinker needs to spend time playing music or painting because it's just, it's the opposite of that, right? You're using the other side of your brain, but it sounds like the way you're painting is very in your head and I would just rip you out of that. And it would be very uncomfortable, but then you could see the kind of like life, right? You just see, throw shit at the wall and see what sticks and through that, it's about control, right?

03:22:12.898 --> 03:22:42.046
I had to, you know, and part of being in 12th step in recovery is like, and, you know, and the wisdom to know the difference, you know, the serenity prayer, is I had to, like, you can't control Mother Nature. You can't control a fire. You can't control what other people are going to think about you or say about you. You just can't. You could try to, let me write a paper and, like, so that...

03:22:42.210 --> 03:23:11.998
And yeah, you could do that for a little bit, but it's tiring and it's exhausting to try to get all these people to believe what, you know, like, and so I, yeah, I just, it's anti, it goes against the word winning and the win surrender, right? Like I win every day because I surrender constantly now.

03:23:12.226 --> 03:23:41.918
Part of that, I gotta still fight, because it's like, you sound like a loser. Why are you giving up? Right, it's going, fucking shut the fuck up. Pick yourself up by your bootstraps and get back in. Like, that's how you become the best. Like, all the other artists, they're like dealing with, like, you don't have kids. You don't get married. You fucking paint. You go to the art store, you buy all the paint up. You fucking keep painting. You steal all the paints. It's like, just keep painting, never stop. And it's all gonna be worth it, because one day you're gonna die, and then legacy.

03:23:42.242 --> 03:24:10.142
Now we see legacy is nothing, right? I get in an Uber, get in the car, fucking smells like teen spirit, right? One of the greatest anthems ever, guy in the car, 27 years, what's this? Well, I'll tell you. You don't know fucking Nirvana? Okay, have you seen Goodfellas? Like whatever, whatever who's the godfather, like go down the list. Nobody cares. It's over. So it's just this.

03:24:10.498 --> 03:24:39.774
just this this is all you have so you've done enough people fucking love you you've helped so many people and I want you to take one year off and I don't care if people are like fuck that guy that guy helps me every day I want to hear his soothing voice every night but I'm like AI bro just use AI no I'm kidding I'm just saying I would love whatever you've been running from whatever you've been doing to like you help a lot of people

03:24:40.162 --> 03:25:09.854
do you help yourself on that level? And it's like, yeah, starting painting, that's taking care of you. Like, it's not complete all or nothing, but someone like you and other people like you are not gonna outsmart the feeling, right? You're not gonna outrun the pain. And it's like, I don't know what your father was like. I don't know what your mom was like, but they're proud of you. Like, you don't need to do more. Like, they're proud of you. And like, if you go to what I said,

03:25:10.018 --> 03:25:34.462
way to really make them proud is to disappoint them you just gotta fucking andrew i'm really disappointed in you then you know you're doing something right you know um sorry for talking over you no i was interrupting what what are you what like your face says a lot so i just want to know what you're try to um well the part about legacy is where i was interrupting but it's not i let let's let it pass because you you

03:25:34.626 --> 03:26:01.598
Yes and yes. The legacy thing, it... It's nothing. It's nothing. Like I've done, I feel like I've done so much in acting. Like I've done all these things and people are like, who's that Chinese kid? I'm like, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Like you do all this stuff so that you have something to leave behind. And I go, you just have this. You just have like right now, today. And that's it. And like, we're gonna, we did this today and then

03:26:02.530 --> 03:26:30.782
and then it's off to the universe. I can't control what people are going to think about me. And it's like, I came here today with my intention of meeting you, telling you how you make me feel and how much I appreciate you. And I did that. So that's it. And I have no ill will. I'm not trying to like, yeah, I probably talk shit about a lot of people right now, but it's like, fine. Okay. That's my, and I should probably just let all that stuff go. But

03:26:31.202 --> 03:27:00.318
Tell someone who's used to winning, who's fought tooth and nail for everything they had to fight and prove people wrong over and over again, to tell someone like that, hey, just surrender. It's like, fuck you, dude. You don't tell me that. So yeah, that journey from head to heart, it's a big one. And that's why the... You can't say that to everyone, right? Because they're like, I got to fucking... But I'm like, I don't know your financial situation, but I'm like, I think you could take a year off. Like...

03:27:00.514 --> 03:27:30.238
It's not for, but that's the other thing, right? Like, must be nice, Dave, from your perspective. And I go, I was homeless. Like, I've lived the worst. Like, people for, like, I know I sound defensive, but like, I wasn't born rich. Like, I worked for this. So it's like, must sound nice from a rich guy's perspective. And I go, if I think back to my happiest moments or even just my most creative moments, it was always less. It was never more.

03:27:30.690 --> 03:28:00.382
So when I lived in a tiny house, that means less doors to open, less walls to, we're living together and it's fucking cold, but at least we got body. I'm making it sound like we were okay, but I'm like, we didn't have that much. And it was great because we had each other. And I think back and I go, okay, creative output, let's go to work. Let's go back into my head. I go, oh, every time I had like a Renaissance level creative explosion,

03:28:00.834 --> 03:28:28.766
was no wi-fi and there was no heater it was always freezing it was cold like you're talking about deprivation yeah like and then now like it's just it would be with my uh attention it would be impossible for me to get anything done if i didn't go out of my way to block all my electronic devices i couldn't do it my social media is on a separate phone it goes into a lockbox that can't be coded out you don't need to get work done i

03:28:28.898 --> 03:28:56.446
what I hear, well, first of all, I want to be clear that, um, I don't need an answer from you. I'm just throwing the, the challenge of the gauntlet down. I would love for you to take one year off as someone who I just met, who I care about. And I like, um, we're humans, right? Can't just run forever. Like there needs to be a recharge or refresh. Like there's just things that I, that you get offered, I guess you're like, I'm never going to do that.

03:28:56.642 --> 03:29:25.598
Why don't you go to this retreat and just work on this part of your heart or this part of your journey for a month? And you're like, I'm not going to fucking do that. And it's like, but why not? You deserve it. And it's going to be hard. It's not like a fun vacation. And like for me, the way I think about it is part of like what – because I take podcasting. So like I'm – I try to manicure –

03:29:26.306 --> 03:29:55.134
I look and sound and I do a lot of people and I try to make it look like I didn't right like before I go on Joe Rogan or Howard Stern I like I call up people and I fucking do like I talk for 12 I go is this work is like and then I come on and I try and that's fake and it's been years since I did a podcast I was like I I'm getting like a very genuine feeling from you and so I don't want to do that today and I was fucking that's why I was puking I was scared I was like I'm just gonna come in and

03:29:55.746 --> 03:30:24.766
I'd say something that like fucks me up because it has so many times, but I'm just going to be the truest version of, I guess I could, that was scary to me. That was like really being naked. Like I, I like to be prepared and I, like last night it was late. I couldn't sleep and I was like, oh fuck, I can't believe. Cause it's like, I live a quiet, like I don't, and I was like, oh man, like, it was like, let me like,

03:30:24.994 --> 03:30:54.366
not like you're the enemy. I was like, oh, I'm going into enemy territory. What if he has like a gotcha question? Like, I have to have a, you know, like it was, it was like I was at Vice again, you know, Vice was so much riffing and witty comebacks. And I was like, this is exhausting. And I was like, but can you just go and just, you know, and I realized it took me like two hours to answer like one question, but that's, I also accept that about myself, you know? But yeah, I started like, I started, I,

03:30:54.626 --> 03:31:22.526
Andrew, and then it was like, it finishes your name. And I was like, I'm not going to do this. I don't want to do this. I don't want to just fucking read about you all night and then like have come in like prepared. Great. Great. I was like, I'm so glad. I'm so glad you abandoned that. I did. I did. I said, just fucking. Dude. Yeah. Man, I'm so grateful you showed up here that in that frame, that no frame frame. Yeah. Um,

03:31:23.426 --> 03:31:52.990
as soon as I start talking, if I say anything kind about you, you're going to get that thing. But I'm just going to tell you. I'll tell you. I'll prepare. I'll sit in. There are a couple reasons you're here. Some of them I touched on earlier. You're an amazing artist. You're an amazing person. But the main reason you're here is because a long time ago, I saw you at a meeting and I learned from you there. And I was like, you know, I would like...

03:31:53.410 --> 03:32:13.726
Oh, wow. And I know I can learn a lot from him. Oh, my God. So without getting into any details about that. I mean, you can. I don't care. Well, maybe another time. I told you. You know, you've helped me a ton. I also, like, I have this –

03:32:13.922 --> 03:32:42.686
Maybe this is the scientist in me, but I feel like you've made yourself like the anvil, the hammer, and the metal. And it's like this cycle of the opportunity to do something, to feel something. And then, I guess my friend Ryan Suave was right. He said, people get addicted to shame. But to me, it's the whole cycle, right? But the thing that I really want you to take in is that people learn from...

03:32:43.202 --> 03:33:08.222
comes out of your mouth. They don't like, yes, the stories are interesting, infinitely interesting and entertaining also. And yes, you have a gift for storytelling, just like you have a gift for art, but it's, you know, people learn and, you know, we touched on Bourdain who I didn't know. I know you and Joe were both close to him. I know a couple other people were close to him and, you know, I'm not, he

03:33:08.322 --> 03:33:37.598
on a public service campaign. That's not how I do this podcast. I'm only here with you right now. But, you know, there are a lot of people offing themselves. A close friend do that recently. A very famous scientist that appeared to have everything. This kind of thing. And it's happening more and more. And I think that when people hear you, when I hear you, I know what people hear. They feel you. And they hear the extent to which, yeah, there are a lot of homes

03:33:37.730 --> 03:34:05.246
stuff and great stuff happened but you're still here and you're still going and that example is really really important well i don't want to i don't want to be a survive you know it's like i'm a survivor because i survived all this stuff but so did everybody and i'm not trying to like and you but you're still going but i don't want to survive i want to thrive right you're a that's why i think of like uh korean jesus or peewee herman and i go it was like i try to

03:34:05.506 --> 03:34:35.102
things light and entertaining it was a lot it was really painful right if if if you get it it wasn't easy and it wasn't easy for everyone but so then you go well will you work on yourself will you do this work will you go to a meeting and it's like are we having fun yet right it's like it's a lot of fucking pain and work to just be you know and the question is like i want to put it's like

03:34:35.522 --> 03:35:03.614
having fun yet like isn't aren't we supposed to have fun like you know my son wakes up every morning laughing I go what the fuck is happening up there what is like I can't remember the last time I woke up smiling it's like and I'm like oh if we can remember like I like it was dumb doing the secret word but I I loved it like you guys scared the shit like I you know and it's people like

03:35:06.114 --> 03:35:32.382
Trigger warning. There's a lot of people killing themselves on an epidemic. Men. I don't know that many women, but a lot of men. Mostly men. And so a powerful tool. Because I've done so much reckless shit. It's a miracle that I'm here right now. And I'm not saying that to be like, oh, I just... No, I think it is a miracle. I could have been dead a lot of times. No, I think God's been looking out for you. So I say to myself without...

03:35:32.546 --> 03:36:01.470
Brandizing myself or being on like some guru messiah type shit. It's like, so I made it through that. I am having fun despite how much I cry and stuff. But even that, like I wouldn't, I would be called a pussy and all that if I did that. And I go, I just, allowing myself to feel everything. And so I learned this tool called just play the tape out.

03:36:02.082 --> 03:36:30.526
So you go, if you're an idiot, you're an idiot. But if you have any level of intelligence, you go, well, how do you think this ends for you? How do you think this drug problem ends for you? How do you think cheating on your wife ends for you? How do you think nonstop, like it doesn't end well, right? That's one of my favorite things to tell my friend. That's okay right now. It's mad. I go, but addiction and it just escalates. It doesn't stay, you don't just kind of get like,

03:36:30.978 --> 03:37:00.798
someone like me it escalates very quickly so it's dangerous and and and addiction loves novelty right so if if someone's sucking dick for crack in an alley right now that little boy he never he wasn't a little boy when they go I hope I do that one day that happened started with weed then it went to coke and it just escalated right he wasn't like I want to do degrading acts that I don't want to do for drugs but it

03:37:00.898 --> 03:37:28.894
escalated and that's on the addict side but I just found myself having a lot of I swear like weird broken problems I swear I'll never do that but then I'm like here I am in this weird place doing weird shit that's going against my value system here I am oh I'm chasing the shame again so I know this is kind of hypocritical because I'm applying logic again but if you just talk to someone and you use this tool of hey you're not an idiot play the tape out

03:37:29.570 --> 03:37:57.470
your behavior that's like chasing a bottom or destructive or not that destructive yet, but it's on the path. And you're like, yeah, I'll be all right. It's like, just play it out. Like, how do you think this ends for you? Right. I go, I need to go back to podcasting. Right. And I, and then I go on these podcasts and I go, are we having fun yet? Or is it like, you seem like you got the weight of the world on your shoulders. You seem miserable. You seem like you can find, like, I'm not,

03:37:57.730 --> 03:38:27.326
In general, I don't find podcasters happy people. It's just like... I go, so... When... Cut. Let's go. Shit. Sponsors. The numbers are going down. I'm like, can we have fun? Is it only about making money? It's enough. It's because we live in a society...

03:38:28.002 --> 03:38:56.670
especially if you live in a city where the messaging from billboards to social, everything is telling you from the second you wake up. It's not hundreds. It's thousands of messages telling you you're not enough, right? And so I do the brain mapping. I do it and it's like, wow, Dave, you're really hard on yourself. You say so much. It's like if someone said that to my friend, I would do something. So it's like a lot of...

03:38:57.218 --> 03:39:26.366
like self-talk and then it feels gay to say I'm enough I'm you know it's like that's that again why why do you have to say it like that it's like oh I'm worthy I am a good person I am a good father I am a good friend I am a good brother you know it's like this sounds like just self-help but I'm I was able to brainwash myself into believing I was the best artist in the world till so why can't I brainwash myself into thinking I'm a good person so then I

03:39:26.722 --> 03:39:52.606
when I meet people, I want to say nice stuff, like real stuff, not like that's how I feel. And it's like, that's weird. I don't want to just tell someone his shirt fits good on him, but it does. I mean, even for black, it does. So, so the tools is like, you know, writing with deodorant, like a thick white chunky deodorant, just so I see it. So it's in my psyche. Cause it's every day it's billboards of good looking people. And I don't look like that. And,

03:39:52.866 --> 03:40:22.718
messaging is all fucked up and unless I'm just gonna say fuck all internet and just move to the African wilderness which I might do I just write on the wall I am worthy I'm enough and I see it every morning when I wash my face and it's just like I'm starting to brainwash myself it's like that's one tool is like telling people I love and I care about how I feel about them not till they're dead not till it's like they're in their bottom and I'm like hey and it's like I tell them every day because that's that's that's all we have and then I say that about myself

03:40:23.074 --> 03:40:51.966
then I can catch myself, like that bridge that was like, basically like a suicide bridge, just like reckless behavior, reckless, irresponsible behavior, immature behavior. But all of this shit is hard because I'm coming at it with generations of a story that says, you need to stay sick. Like when you hear Kanye say, bipolar is my superpower. Like there's a part of me that's like, of course. And I like my art is fucked up. The more fucked up you are, that's true genius. That's, you know, and I go,

03:40:54.466 --> 03:41:20.702
friends close to me that go as someone who's as creative as you is so you're so like boring and small thinking when you just buy into those things it's like like is there anyone who lives a moderate life just a regular does everything doesn't have to be jumping on a train and like that is doing great art and i go show me an example there's and i go but couldn't you be the first well there's ego and narcissism and it's just like just

03:41:21.026 --> 03:41:46.366
okay fine let's just go let's go with let's play that tape out let's just say for you to make the choice to be a normal person you're never gonna have the best podcast or the best art you're just gonna be kind of like right there 70 what's wrong with that you know but that's not that's going against everything right so i have to it's hard you know and especially something with art where it's in

03:41:47.202 --> 03:42:11.326
just people that are like you're literally doing the worst art i've ever seen in my life you know i wish you know it's like oh their first album was good type shit you know and there's part of me that's like yeah the earlier stuff had more angst and way more detail and more labored over and the stuff now is way more looser and but i love it now like i like i like myself how i feel and it's it's very rare that you have

03:42:12.930 --> 03:42:41.982
you know, the whole lonely at the top that you have these champions, people that are like the best at what they do, the top 1% of the world champion of this, this, that you meet them and they're just like a content, satisfied, happy, they're just miserable. And you're like, what was the point? Why? And it's either you have the courage through yourself and friends to make that change,

03:42:42.178 --> 03:43:08.574
If you take a year off, we're going to hang out a lot. We're going to paint. That's awesome incentive. We're going to do all that. But it's always like, you got to do it alone. That was my message. Shut the fuck up. Don't complain. Very Asian, very Korean. Don't say anything. Someone fucking treats you like shit. Keep your head down and just... It's all revenge is a dish best served cold. Just fucking shut... Don't ever...

03:43:08.898 --> 03:43:37.214
know see what you coming see how you feel and just your your your revenge is success like just like that guy treated you shit at work then just become the guy that owns that business and then fire him you know like um oh i'm so fucking glad that guy chip got fired that felt so good chip sounds like an he was such an but i so you just i i have in those things all these tools are like okay cool they're all simple

03:43:37.634 --> 03:44:07.166
okay, wake up every day and say I'm a good person. Yeah, it's simple, but it's hard. It's not easy. You have to like work at it. And feel it. Yeah, like, oh, get up every day and do 100 push-ups. I could do that, but I don't. But you could. It's like, but you care about your physical health, but why wouldn't you do that for your mental health, your spiritual health? You know, oh, I'm not religious. It's like spirituality is the ocean. It's the universe. It's a power greater than you, right? So...

03:44:08.386 --> 03:44:36.766
playing the tape out is a very valuable, powerful, I need to take action in this way and sometimes the action is to do less and it's to do nothing where everything growing up was do more and I was going to say, am I making any sense? But through your face I could see that I feel like

03:44:37.218 --> 03:45:05.630
I feel heard and I feel understood in this moment, which is very special to me. So thank you. Thank you. You are absolutely heard and you're absolutely understood. And I'm very grateful to you. And I know everyone listening is to the permission to tell oneself and feel that they are enough is that's oddly the hardest thing. But the encouragement is is

03:45:06.338 --> 03:45:34.366
it lands. I think also because I talk so much about shame and I'll end it with this it feels like is hope and faith is also a very powerful drug and sometimes like I said with my mom or me believing in Santa like there's no logic in that but you know entire wars and nations are fought over faith and you know and

03:45:35.650 --> 03:46:05.406
I feel like because I'm sensitive and I'm empathetic to everybody that I meet, that it feels like a really hopeless time. And I feel like that's why there's a lot of self-harm and depression. And so it's like weird. It's like, how would you be hopeful in a city like LA where there's like 70,000 homeless people, like natural disasters, drug epidemics, you know, just all this shit. And it's like, then to...

03:46:07.362 --> 03:46:34.654
you know, to, to, to brainwash yourself. Like if, cause it's, that's what the connection is like. If I don't believe it to find, to go out there and meet someone in real life and say, Hey, I'm having, it was like the hardest thing to do. It was like, I need help right now. I can't, it's like weird to admit to someone that I can't do. Like I can't, I can't even come up with one nice thing to say about myself. Can I, can you say something nice about me?

03:46:35.138 --> 03:47:05.022
That sounds very egotistic, but I need that right now. I really don't like myself right now. And to have someone say something nice and you go, okay, maybe tomorrow I'll be able to say something nice about myself. And then you're building something called hope and faith. And so I don't know, I told a long Pee Wee Herman story, but at the end of that, I was like, what was that? It's like, okay, that's resilience. That's taking chance. That's believing in yourself.

03:47:07.426 --> 03:47:36.830
I never gave up hope. You know, it's like, and it's just, and that's delusional in a way, but that's, like how? Like if you take facts and numbers and it's like, this is the end of the world. This is like me, AI's gonna kill, like all this fucking doomsday post-apocalyptic. It's like, I don't need that shit, dude. I don't watch horror movies. I don't surround myself with like, that's fine. Like that's,

03:47:36.962 --> 03:48:05.342
and do your own thing. And like I said, you know, we were both like, we like punk, but we don't like hardcore. Like I used to love hardcore because it's, I needed that. I needed to hear that message vibrationally and spiritually and sonically to go like, oh, that guy's singing at a frequency that's resonating with me. It doesn't now. And I fucking hated reggae my whole life because those people were happy. And now I listen to reggae. You know, I go reggae on the river or whatever, you know, like, and I'm just like, you

03:48:05.442 --> 03:48:34.654
and I immediately judge, I can't believe you're fucking listening to reggae. This is like stoner music, but the frequency is hitting me now. So I can be appreciative of hardcore music, but yeah, if I look back and I go, what was that? What the fuck was that? It was just screaming for help, lost and hopeless. And I just go, hope is a hard thing to...

03:48:35.298 --> 03:49:02.110
in a time like this but not if you ask for help not if you reach out not if you connect with other people and that is gonna be impossible to do if you don't you need to you know now i sound like i'm gonna know it all but it's like you need to deprive yourself of electronics like it has to happen like you can't have real emotion if you're watching tv or your phone like

03:49:02.498 --> 03:49:31.134
the only way. Like, anytime... It's like a secret language. Anytime I'm out and someone has a clamshell phone or a flip phone, a dumb phone, whatever, a brick phone, they have whatever you call it, I give a wink. I go... Yeah. Because I know I'm like, this guy, he cares about himself. Because you can't... Oh, I gotta fucking... Like, no, you don't. You don't need to know who's being murdered on every country and... What are you going to do about it? Nothing. So... I believe...

03:49:32.002 --> 03:50:01.406
I have faith that we're all here for a reason. And to anyone listening, and I don't know when this is coming out, and I didn't know, I honestly didn't know I was going to publicly come out about my belief in Santa Claus, but it is the season. Is this going to come out soon or after Christmas? Okay. Just try it on. Just like, I know it's stupid, but just believe in Santa. Like all the, I know kids already do, but any grownups, bitter, jaded adults listening, just...

03:50:02.146 --> 03:50:27.006
try it on this this year just and if you need you know he can teleport he's a mutant he has special abilities and he knows if you've been naughty or nice so yeah I don't I don't know we could I could like this is the problem because where we're at now is when I would start like I'm this was like the pre like when I used to do my podcast DVD I say we this be like oh

03:50:28.098 --> 03:50:57.502
a podcast because it wasn't a conversation it was you talking the whole time and we're three hours in and be like okay now let's now let's start let's get ugly and real and be like nobody likes to talk for nine hours dude I'm like I do so I'm gonna I feel like you'd be down if we wanted to go six more hours easy and we could maybe do that one day we should but I feel like I don't know am I am I you know what I'm surrendering

03:50:58.850 --> 03:51:22.942
I feel like unless you have more shit to ask me, then I'm down. Oh, man. In the language of meetings and other things, I think for now we're complete. Thank you so much, man. Thank you. Thank you. That was so, I mean, I feel good. I feel good, too. Very grateful. Thank you. Thank you.

Please put those in the comments section on YouTube. I do read all the comments. For those of you that haven't heard, I have a new book coming out. It's my very first book. It's entitled Protocols, an Operating Manual for the Human Body. This is a book that I've been working on for more than five years, and that's based on more than 30 years of research and experience. And it covers protocols for everything from sleep to exercise, to stress control,

03:52:25.314 --> 03:52:45.310
related to focus and motivation. And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation for the protocols that are included. The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com. There you can find links to various vendors. You can pick the one that you like best. Again, the book is called Protocols, an Operating Manual for the Human Body.

If you're not already following me on social media, I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms. So that's Instagram, X, Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn. And on all those platforms, I discuss science and science-related tools, some of which overlaps with the content of the Huberman Lab podcast, but much of which is distinct from the information on the Huberman Lab podcast. Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms. And if you haven't already subscribed to our Neural Network newsletter, the Neural Network newsletter is a zero-cost monthly newsletter that includes podcast summaries as well

03:53:15.632 --> 03:53:41.310
what we call protocols in the form of one to three page PDFs that cover everything from how to optimize your sleep, how to optimize dopamine, deliberate cold exposure. We have a foundational fitness protocol that covers cardiovascular training and resistance training. All of that is available completely zero cost. You simply go to Hubermanlab.com, go to the menu tab in the top right corner, scroll down to newsletter and enter your email. And I should emphasize that we do not share your email with anybody.

Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion with David Cho. And last, but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science.
